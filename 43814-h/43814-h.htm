<h2><a name="THE_TRANSPORTATION_QUESTION" id="THE_TRANSPORTATION_QUESTION">THE TRANSPORTATION QUESTION.</a></h2>


<p>The great question of <span class="smcap">Secondary
Punishments</span> has now been settled
by experience, so far as the mother
country is concerned. It is now
known that imprisonment has no
effect whatever, either in deterring
from crime, or in reforming criminals.
Government, albeit most unwilling
to recur to the old system of transportation,
has been compelled to do
so by the unanimous voice of the
country; by the difficulty of finding
accommodation for the prodigious increase
of prisoners in the jails of the
kingdom; and by the still greater difficulty,
in these days of cheapness and
declining incomes, of getting the persons
intrusted with the duty of providing
additional prison accommodation,
to engage in the costly and tedious work
of additional erections. An order in
council has expressly, and most wisely,
authorised a return to transportation,
under such regulations as seem best
calculated to reform the convicts, and
diminish the dread very generally felt
in the colonies, of being flooded with
an inundation of crime from the mother
country. And the principal difficulty
felt now is, to find a colony willing to
receive the penal settlers, and incur the
risks thought to be consequent on their
unrestricted admission.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that government
should have been driven from the
ruinous system of substituting imprisonment
for transportation; for the
results, even during the short period
that it was followed out, were absolutely
appalling. The actual augmentation
of criminals was the least part
of the evil; the increase of serious
crimes, in consequence of the hardened
offenders not being sent out of
the country, but generally liberated
after eighteen months' or two years'
confinement, was the insupportable
evil. The demoralisation so strongly
felt and loudly complained of in Van
Diemen's Land, from the accumulation
of criminals, was rapidly taking
place in this country. The persons
tried under the aggravation of previous
convictions in Scotland, in the
three last years, have stood as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&mdash;<i>Parliamentary Reports</i>, 1846-48.</p>


<p>So rapid an increase of crimes, and
especially among criminals previously
convicted, sufficiently demonstrates
the inadequacy of imprisonment as a
means either of deterring from crimes,
or reforming the criminals. The same
result appears in England, where the
rapid increase of criminals sentenced
to transportation, within the same
period, demonstrates the total inefficacy
of the new imprisonment system.</p>

<p>And of the futility of the hope that the
spread of education will have any effect
in checking the increase of crime, decisive
proof is afforded in the same criminal
returns; for from them it appears
that the number of educated criminals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
in England is above twice, in Scotland
<i>above three times and a half that of the
uneducated</i>,&mdash;the numbers, during the

<p>Nay, what is still more alarming,

<i>steadily on the increase</i> in Great
Britain. Take the centesimal proportions

<p>&mdash;<i>Parliamentary Returns for England</i>, 1848, p. 12.</p>


<p>The great increase here is in the
criminals who have received an <i>imperfect
education</i>, which class has increased
as much as that of the totally
uneducated has diminished. Unhappily,
imperfect education is precisely
the species of instruction which alone,
in the present days of cheapened production
and diminishing wages, the
great body of the poor are able to
give to their children.</p>

<p>Mr Pearson, M.P., who has paid
great attention to this subject, and
whose high official situation in the
city of London gives him such ample
means of being acquainted with the
practical working of the criminal law,
has given the following valuable
information in a public speech, which
every one acquainted with the subject
must know to be thoroughly well
founded:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the year 1810, which is the earliest
account that we possess in any of our archives,
the number of commitments, of
assize and sessions cases, was 5146. In
the year 1848, the number of commitments
for sessions and assize cases was
30,349. Population during that period
had increased but 60 per cent, whilst
the commitments for crime had increased
420 per cent. I should not be candid
with this assembly if I did not at once
say, that there are various disturbing circumstances
which intervene, during that
period, to prevent the apparent increase
of commitments being the real estimate
of the actual increase. There was the
transition from war to peace. We all
know, that from the days of Hollingshed,
the old chronicler, it has been said
that war takes to itself a portion of the
loose population, who find in the casualties
of war, its dangers, rewards and
profligate indulgences, something like a
kindred feeling to the war made upon
society by the predatory classes. Hence
we find that, when war ceases, a number
of that class of the community are thrown
back on the honest portion of society,
which, during the period of war, had
been drained off. Besides this, there are
other co-operating causes. There is the
improved police, the constabulary, rural
or metropolitan, who undoubtedly detect
many of those offences which were formerly
committed with impunity. There
is also the act of parliament for paying
prosecutors and witnesses their expenses,
which led to an increased number of prosecutors
in proportion to the number of
crimes actually detected. These circumstances
have, no doubt, exercised a considerable
influence over the increase in
the commitments; but after having for
35 years paid the closest attention to the
subject, having filled, and still filling, a
high office in regard to the administration
of the law in the city of London, I am
bound to say, that, making full deduction
from the number which every feeling of
anxiety to raise the country from the imputation
of increasing in its criminal
character dictates&mdash;after making every
deduction, I am bound with shame and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
humility to acknowledge, that it leaves
a very large amount of increase in
the actual, the positive number of commitments
for crime. Sir, this is indeed
a humiliating acknowledgment;
but happily the statistics of this country,
in other particulars, warrant us
in drawing comfort from the conviction,
that even this fact affords no true representation
of the state of the moral character
of the people&mdash;no evidence of their
increasing degradation of character or
conduct, in anything like the proportion
or degree that those statistics would appear
to show. I appeal to history&mdash;I appeal
to the recollection of every man in
this assembly, who, like myself, has
passed the meridian of life, whether society
has not advanced in morals as well as in
arts, science, and literature, and everything
which tends to improve the social
character of the people. Let any man
who has read not our country's history
alone, but the tales and novels of former
times&mdash;and we must frequently look to
them, rather than to the records of history,
for a faithful transcript of the morals
of the age in which they were written,&mdash;let
any man recur to the productions of
Fielding and of Smollett, and say whether
the habits, manners, and morals of the
great masses of our population are not
materially improved within the last century.
Great popular delusions prevail as
to the causes of the increase of commitments
for criminal offences in this country,
which I deem it to be my duty to
endeavour to dispel. Some ascribe the
increase to the want of instruction of our
youth, some to the absence of religious
teaching, some to the increased intemperance,
and some to the increased poverty
of the people. I assert that there is no
foundation for the opinions that ascribe
the increase of crime to these causes. If
the absence of education were the cause
of crime, surely crime would be found to
have diminished since education has increased.
For the purpose of comparing
the present and past state of education,
for its influence upon the criminal statistics
of the nation, I will not go back to the
time when the single Bible in the parish
was chained to a pillar in the church; or
when the barons affixed their cross to
documents, from inability to write their
names. I refer to dates, and times, and circumstances
within our own recollection. In
the year 1814 the report of the National
Society says, there were only 100,000
children receiving the benefit of education.
Now there are above 1,000,000
under that excellent institution, besides
the tens of thousands and hundreds of
thousands who are receiving education
under the auspices of the Lancasterian
Society Schools. But some may say that
the value of education is not to be estimated
by numbers. Well then, I reject
numbers, if you please, and try it by its
quality. I ask any man who listens to
me if he does not know that the national
schools, and other gratuitous establishments
in this country, now give privileges
in education which children in a respectable
condition of life could hardly obtain,
such was the defective state of instruction
in this country, 40 or 50 years ago.
(Cheers.) No man, therefore, can say
that the increase of crime is attributable
to the absence of education. If it were
so, with education increased 800 per
cent during the last 30 years, crime
would have diminished, instead of increased,
400 per cent."&mdash;<i>Times</i>, Aug. 28,
1849.</p></blockquote>

<p>The immense <i>expense</i> with which
the maintenance of such prodigious
numbers of prisoners in jail is
attended, is another most serious
evil, especially in these days of
retrenchment, diminished profits,
and economy. From the last Report
of the Jail Commissioners for Scotland&mdash;that
for 1848&mdash;it appears that
the average cost of each prisoner
over the whole country for a year,
after deducting his earnings in confinement,
is &pound;16, 7s. 6d. As this is
the cost after labour has been generally
introduced into prisons, and the
greatest efforts to reduce expense
have been made, it may fairly be
presumed that it cannot be reduced
lower. The average number of prisoners
constantly in jail in Scotland is
now about 3500, which, at &pound;16, 7s.
6d. a-head, will come to about
&pound;53,000 a-year.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Applying this proportion
to the 60,000 criminals, now
on an average constantly in confinement
in the two islands,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the annual
expense of their maintenance cannot
be under a million sterling. The
prison and county rates of England
alone, which include the cost of prosecutions,
are &pound;1,300,000 a-year. But
that result, enormous as it is in a
country in which poor-rates and all
local burdens are so rapidly augmenting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>is but a part of the evil. Under
the present system a thief is seldom
transported, at least in Scotland, till
he has been three or four years plying
his trade; during which period his
gains by depredations, and expenses
of maintenance, cannot have averaged
less than &pound;25 yearly. Thus it may with
safety be affirmed, that every thief
transported from Scotland <i>has cost the
country, before he goes, at least &pound;100</i>;
and that has been expended in training
him up to such habits of hardened
depravity, that he is probably as
great a curse to the colony to which
he is sent, as he had proved a burden
to that from which he was conveyed.
<i>Sixteen pounds</i> would have been the cost
of his transportation in the outset of his
career, when, from his habits of crime
not being matured, he had a fair chance
of proving an acquisition, instead of a
curse, to the place of his destination.</p>

<p>As the question of imprisonment
or transportation, so far as Great
Britain and Ireland are concerned,
is now settled by the demonstrative
evidence of the return of a reluctant
government to the system which
in an evil hour they abandoned,
it may seem unnecessary to go into
detail in order to show how absolutely
necessary it was to do so;
and how entirely the boasted system
of imprisonment, with all its adjuncts
of separation, silence, hard labour,
and moral and religious instruction,
has failed either in checking crime, or
producing any visible reformation in
the criminals. No one practically
acquainted with the subject ever
entertained the slightest doubt that
this would be the case; and in two
articles directed to the subject in this
magazine, in 1844, we distinctly
foretold what the result would be.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
To those who, following in the wake
of prelates or philanthropists, how
respectable soever, such as Archbishop
Whately, who know nothing
whatever of the subject except from
the fallacious evidence of parliamentary
committees, worked up by their
own theoretical imaginations, we recommend
the study of the Tables below,
compiled from the parliamentary
returns since the imprisonment system
began, to show to what a pass the
adoption of their rash visions has
brought the criminal administration of
the country.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It is not surprising that it should be
so, and that all the pains taken, and
philanthropy wasted, in endeavouring
to reform criminals in jail in this country,
or hindering them from returning
to their old habits when let loose within
it, should have proved abortive. Two
reasons of paramount efficacy have rendered
them all nugatory. The first of
these is, that the theory regarding the
possibility of reforming offenders when
in prison, or suffering punishment in
this country, is wholly erroneous, and
proceeds on an entire misconception
of the principles by which alone such
a reformation can in any case be
effected. In prison, how solitary so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>ever,
you can work only on the <i>intellectual</i>
faculties. The <i>active</i> powers
or feelings can receive no development
within the four walls of a cell, for they
have no object by which they can be
called forth. But nine-tenths of
mankind in any rank, and most certainly
nineteen-twentieths of persons
bred as criminals, are wholly
inaccessible to the influence of the
intellect, considered as a restraint
or regulator of their passions. If
they had been capable of being influenced
in that way, they would
never have become criminals. Persons
who fall into the habits which
bring them under the lash of the
criminal law, are almost always those
in whom, either from natural disposition,
or the unhappy circumstances of
early habits and training, the intellectual
faculties are almost entirely
in abeyance, so far as self-control is
concerned; and any development they
have is only directed to procuring
gratification for, or furthering the objects
of the senses. To address to such
persons the moral discipline of a prison,
however admirably conducted, is as
hopeless as it would be to descant
to a man born blind on the objects of
sight, or to preach to an ignorant boor
in the Greek or Hebrew tongue.
Sense is to them all in all. Esau is
the true prototype of this class of
men; they are always ready to exchange
their birthright for a mess of
pottage.</p>

<p>No length of solitary confinement,
or scarce any amount of moral or religious
instruction, can awaken in them
either the slightest repentance for their
crimes, or the least power of self-control
when temptation is again thrown
in their way. They regard the period
of imprisonment as a blank in their
lives&mdash;a time of woful monotony and
total deprivation of enjoyment, which
only renders it the more imperative on
them, the moment it is terminated, to
begin anew with fresh zest their old
enjoyments. Their first object is to
make up for months of compulsory
sobriety by days of voluntary intoxication.
At the close of a short
period of hideous <i>saturnalia</i>, they are
generally involved in some fresh
housebreaking or robbery, to pay for
their long train of indulgence; and
soon find themselves again immured
in their old quarters, only the more
determined to run through the same
course of forced regularity and willing
indulgence. They are often able to
feign reformation, so as to impose on
their jailors, and obtain liberation on
pretended amendment of character.
But it is rarely if ever that they are
really reclaimed; and hence the perpetual
recurrences of the same characters
in the criminal courts; till the
magistrates, tired of imprisoning
them, send them to the assizes or
quarter-sessions for transportation.
Even then, however, their career is
often far from being terminated in this
country. The keepers of the public
penitentiaries become tired of keeping
them. When they cannot send them
abroad, their cells are soon crowded;
and they take advantage of a feigned
amendment to open the prison doors
and let them go. They are soon
found again in their old haunts, and
at their old practices. At the spring
circuit held at Glasgow in April 1848,
when the effects of the recent imprisonment
mania were visible,&mdash;out of
117 ordinary criminals indicted, no
less than <i>twenty-two</i> had been sentenced
to transportation at Glasgow,
for periods not less than seven years,
<i>within the preceding two years</i>; and the
previous conviction and sentence of
transportation was charged as an aggravation
of their new offence against each
in the indictment.</p>

<p>The next reason which renders imprisonment,
in an old society and
amidst a redundant population, utterly
inefficacious as a means of reforming
criminals is, that, even if they do imbibe
better ideas and principles during
their confinement, they find it impossible
on their liberation to get into any
honest employment, or gain admission
into any well-doing circle, where they
may put their newly-acquired principles
into practice. If, indeed, there
existed a government or parochial
institution, into which they might be
received on leaving prison, and by
which they might be marched straightway
to the nearest seaport, and there
embarked for Canada or Australia, a
great step would be made towards
giving them the means of durable reformation.
But as there is none such
in existence, and as they scarcely
ever are possessed of money enough, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
leaving prison, to carry them across
the Atlantic, they are of necessity
obliged to remain in their own country&mdash;and
that, to persons in their situation,
is certain ruin. In new colonies,
or thinly-peopled countries, such as
Australia or Siberia, convicts, from the
scarcity of labour, may in general be
able to find employment; and from the
absence of temptation, and the severance
of the links which bound them
to their old associates, they are often
there found to do well. But nothing
of that sort can be expected in an old
and thickly-peopled country, where
the competition for employment is universal,
and masters, having the choice
of honest servants of untainted character,
cannot be expected to take
persons who have been convicted of
crimes, and exposed to the pollutions
of a jail.</p>

<p>Practically speaking, it is <i>impossible</i>
for persons who have been in jail to
get into any honest or steady employment
in their own country; and if they
do by chance, or by the ignorance of
their employers of their previous history,
get into a situation, it is ere long
discovered, by the associates who come
about them, where they have been, and
they speedily lose it. If you ask any
person who has been transported in consequence
of repeated convictions, why
he did not take warning by the first, the
answer uniformly is, that he could
not get into employment, and was
obliged to take to thieving, or starve.
Add to this that the newly-reformed
criminal, on leaving jail, and idling
about, half starved, in search of work,
of necessity, as well as from inclination,
finds his way back to his old residence,
where his character is known,
and he is speedily surrounded by his
old associates, who, in lieu of starving
integrity, offer him a life of joyous and
well-fed depravity. It can hardly be
expected that human virtue, and least
of all the infant virtue of a newly-reformed
criminal, can withstand so
rude a trial. Accordingly, when the
author once asked Mr Brebner, the
late governor of the Glasgow bridewell,
what proportion of formed criminals
he ever knew to have been
reformed by prison discipline, he answered
that the proportion was easily
told, for <i>he never knew one</i>. And in
the late debate in parliament on this
subject, it was stated by the Home
Secretary, Sir George Grey, that
while the prison discipline at Pentonville
promised the most cheering results,
it was among those trained
there, and <i>subsequently transported</i>,
that the improvement was visible; for
that no such results were observed
among those who, after liberation,
were allowed to remain in this country.</p>

<p>But while it is thus proved, both
by principle and experience, that the
moral reformation of offenders cannot
be effected by imprisonment, even
under the most improved system, in
this country, yet, in one respect, a
very great amelioration of the prisoner's
habits, and extension of his
powers, is evidently practicable. It is
easy <i>to teach a prisoner a trade</i>; and
such is the proficiency which is rapidly
acquired by the undivided attention
to one object in a jail, that one
objection which has been stated to
the imprisonment system is, that it
interferes with the employment of
honest industry out of doors. No
one can walk through any of the
well-regulated prisons in Great Britain
without seeing that, whatever
else you cannot do, it is easy to teach
such a proficiency in trade to the
convicts as may render them, if their
depraved inclinations can be arrested,
useful members of society, and give
them the means of earning a livelihood
by honest industry. Many of
them are exceedingly clever, evince
great aptitude for the learning of
handicrafts, and exert the utmost
diligence in their prosecution. Let
no man, however, reckon on their
reformation, because they are thus
skilful and assiduous: turn them out
of prison in this country, and you will
soon see them drinking and thieving
with increased alacrity, from the
length of their previous confinement.
It is evidently not intellectual cunning,
or manual skill, or vigour in pursuit,
which they in general want&mdash;it is the
power of directing their faculties to
proper objects, when at large in this
country, which they are entirely without,
and which no length of confinement,
or amount of moral and religious
instruction communicated in prison, is
able to confer upon them. Here then
is one great truth ascertained, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
only sure guide in such matters&mdash;<i>experience</i>&mdash;that
while it is wholly
impossible to give prisoners the
power of controlling their passions, or
abstaining from their evil propensities,
when at large, by any amount of
prison discipline, it is always not
only possible, but easy, to communicate
to them such handicraft skill, or
power of exercising trades, as may,
the moment the wicked dispositions
are brought under control, render
them useful and even valuable members
of society.</p>

<p>Experience equally proves that,
though the moral reformation of convicts
in this country is so rare as, practically
speaking, to be considered as
impossible, yet this is very far indeed
from being the case when they are removed
to a distant land, where all connexion
with their old associates is at
once and for ever broken; where an
honest career is not only open, but easy,
to the most depraved, and a boundless
supply of fertile but unappropriated
land affords scope for the exercise of
the desire of gain on legitimate objects,
and affords no facilities for the commission
of crime, or the acquisition of
property, by the short-hand methods of
theft or robbery. Lord Brougham,
in a most able work, which is little
known only because it runs counter to
the prejudices of the age, has well
explained the causes of this peculiarity:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The new emigrants, who at various
times continued to flock to the extensive
country of America, were by no means of
the same description with the first settlers.
Some of these were the scourings of jails,
banished for their crimes; many of them
were persons of desperate fortunes, to
whom every place was equally uninviting;
or men of notoriously abandoned lives, to
whom any region was acceptable that
offered them a shelter from the vengeance
of the law, or the voice of public indignation.
But a change of scene will work
some improvement upon the most dissolute
of characters. It is much to be removed
from the scenes with which villany has been
constantly associated, and the companions
who have rendered it agreeable. It is something
to have the leisure of a long voyage,
with its awakening terrors, to promote reflection.
Besides, to regain once more the
privilege of that good name, which every
unknown man may claim until he is tried,
presents a powerful temptation to reform,
and furnishes an opportunity of amendment
denied in the scenes of exposure
and destruction. If the convicts in the
colony of New Holland, though surrounded
on the voyage and in the settlement by
the companions of their iniquities, have
in a great degree been reclaimed by the
mere change of scene, what might not be
expected from such a change as we are
considering? But the honest acquisition
of a little property, and its attendant
importance, is, beyond any other circumstance,
the one most calculated to reform
the conduct of a needy and profligate
man, by inspiring him with a respect for
himself and a feeling of his stake in the
community, and by putting a harmless
and comfortable life at least within the
reach of his exertions. If the property
is of a nature to require constant industry,
in order to render it of any value; if it
calls forth that sort of industry which
devotes the labourer to a solitary life in
the open air, and repays him not with
wealth and luxury, but with subsistence
and ease; if, in short, it is property in
land, divided into small portions and
peopled by few inhabitants, no combination
of circumstances can be figured to
contribute more directly to the reformation
of the new cultivator's character and
manners."<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In addition to these admirable
observations, it may be stated, as
another, and perhaps the principal
reason why transportation, when conducted
on proper principles, is attended
with such immediate and beneficial influences
on the moral character of the
convict, that it places him in situations
where scope is afforded for the
development of the <i>domestic and generous
affections</i>. A counterpoise is
provided to self. It is the impossibility
of providing such a counterpoise
within the four walls of a cell&mdash;the
extreme difficulty of finding it, in any
circumstances in which a prisoner can
be placed, on his liberation from jail in
his own country, which is the chief
cause of the total failure of all attempts
to work a moral reform on prisoners,
when kept at home, by any, even the
most approved system of jail discipline.
But that which cannot be obtained at
home is immediately, on transportation,
found in the colonies. The criminal
is no longer thrown back on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>himself in the solitude of a cell&mdash;he is
not surrounded by thieves and prostitutes,
urging him to resume his old
habits, on leaving it. The female convict,
on arriving in New South Wales,
is almost immediately married; ere
long the male, if he is industrious and
well-behaved, has the means of being
so. Regular habits then come to
supplant dissolute&mdash;the natural affections
spring up in the heart with the
creation of the objects on which they
are to be exercised. The solitary
tenant of a cell&mdash;the dissolute frequenter
of spirit-cellars and bagnios,
acquires <i>a home</i>. The affections of the
fireside begin to spring up, because a
fireside is obtained.</p>

<p>Incalculable is the effect of this
change of circumstances on the character
of the most depraved. Accordingly
it is mentioned by Mr Cunningham, in
his very interesting <i>Account of New
South Wales</i>, that great numbers of
young women taken from the streets of
London, who have resisted all efforts
of Christian zeal and philanthropy in
Magdalene Asylums or Penitentiaries
at home, and embark for New South
Wales in the most shocking state of
depravity, become sensibly improved
in their manners, and are not unfrequently
entirely reformed by forming,
during the voyage, <i>temporary connections
with sailors</i>, to whom, when the
choice is once made, they generally remain
faithful: so powerful and immediate
is the effect of an approach even
to a home, and lasting ties, on the female
heart.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The feelings which offspring
produces are never entirely obliterated
in the breast of woman. It has been
often observed, that though dissolute
females generally, when they remain
at home, find it impossible to reform
their own lives, yet they rarely, if
they have the power, fail to bring up
their children at a distance from their
haunts of iniquity. So powerful is the
love of children, and the secret sense
of shame at their own vices, in the
breasts even of the most depraved of
the female sex.</p>

<p>It has been proved, accordingly, by
experience, on the very largest scale,
not only that the reformation of offenders,
when transported to a colony
in a distant part of the world, takes
place, if they are preserved <i>in a due
proportion of numerical inferiority to
the untainted population</i>, to an extent
unparalleled in any other situation;
but that, when so regulated, they constitute
the <i>greatest possible addition to
the strength, progress, and riches of a
colony</i>. From official papers laid before
parliament, before the unhappy
crowding of convicts in New South
Wales began, and the gang-system
was introduced, it appears that between
the years 1800 and 1817&mdash;that
is, in seventeen years&mdash;out of 17,000
convicts transported to New South
Wales, no less than <i>six thousand had,
at the close of the period, obtained their
freedom from their good conduct, and
had earned among them, by their free
labour, property to the amount of
&pound;1,500,000</i>! It may be safely affirmed
that the history of the world does not
afford so astonishing and gratifying
an instance of the moral reformation
of offenders, or one pointing so clearly
to the true system to be pursued regarding
them. It will be recollected
that this reformation took place when
17,000 convicts were transported in
seventeen years&mdash;that is, on an average,
1000 a-year only&mdash;and when the gang-system
was unknown, and the convict
on landing at Sidney was immediately
assigned to a free colonist, by whom
he was forthwith marched up the
country into a remote situation, and
employed under his master's direction
in rural labour or occupations.</p>

<p>And that the colony itself prospers
immensely from the forced labour of
convicts being added, <i>in not too great
proportions</i>, to the voluntary labour of
freemen, is decisively proved by the
astonishing progress which Australia
has made during the last fifty years;
the degree in which it has distanced
all its competitors in which convict
labour was unknown; and the marvellous
amount of wealth and comfort,
so much exceeding upon the whole
that known in any other colony, which
now exists among its inhabitants. We
say upon the whole, because we are
well aware that in some parts of Australia,
particularly Van Diemen's
Land, property has of late years been
most seriously depreciated in value&mdash;partly
from the monetary crisis, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>has affected that distant settlement as
well as the rest of the empire, and
partly from the inordinate number of
convicts who have been sent to that
one locality, from the vast increase
of crime at home, and the cessations of
transportation to Sidney;&mdash;a number
which has greatly exceeded the proper
and salutary proportion to freemen,
and has been attended with the most
disastrous results. But that the introduction
of convicts, when not too depraved,
and kept in due subordination
by being in a <i>small minority compared
to the freemen</i>, is, so far from being an
evil, the greatest possible advantage
to a colony, is decisively proved by the
parliamentary returns quoted below,
showing the comparative progress
during a long course of years of Australia,
aided by convict labour, and
the Cape of Good Hope and Canada,
which have not enjoyed that advantage.
These returns are decisive.
They demonstrate that the progress
of the convict colonies, during the
last half century, has been three times
as rapid as that of those enjoying
equal or greater advantages, to whom
convicts have not been sent; and that
the present state of comforts they
enjoy, as measured by the amount
per head of British manufactures they
consume, is also triple that of any
other colony who have been kept
entirely clear from the supposed stain,
but real advantages, of forced labour.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly, the ablest and best-informed
statistical writers and travellers
on the Continent, struck with
the safe and expeditious method of
getting quit of and reforming its
convicts which Great Britain enjoys,
from its numerous colonies in every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>part of the world, and the want of
which is so severely felt in the Continental
states, are unanimous in considering
the possession of such colonies,
and consequent power of unlimited
transportation, as one of the
very greatest social advantages which
England enjoys. Hear what one of
the most enlightened of those writers,
M. Malte-Brun, says on the subject:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"England has long been in the habit of
disposing of its wicked citizens in a way
at once philosophic and politic, by sending
them out to cultivate distant colonies.
It was thus that the shores of the Delaware
and the Potomac were peopled in
America. After the American war, they
were at a loss where to send the convicts,
and the Cape of Good Hope was
first thought of; but, on the recommendation
of the learned Sir Joseph Banks,
New South Wales obtained the preference.
The first vessel arrived at Botany
Bay on the 20th January 1788, and
brought out 760 convicts, and according
to a census taken in 1821, exhibited the
following results in thirty-three years,
viz.&mdash;</p></blockquote>



<div class="tdr">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" summary="table">
<tr><td class="tdl">Free settlers, men, women and children</td><td>23,254</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Convicts</td><td class="bb">13,814</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td class="tdl">37,068"</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In 1832, that population had risen
to 40,000 souls.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In 1821, there
were in the colony 5000 horses,
120,000 horned cattle, and 350,000
sheep. It consumed, at that period,
8,500,000 francs' (&pound;340,000) worth of
English manufactures, being about
&pound;8, 10s. a-head, and exported to
Europe about &pound;100,000 worth in rude
produce.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Great division of opinion has existed
in France, for a long course of years, on
the possibility of diminishing the frequency
of the punishment of death, as
well as that of the galleys; but a serious
difficulty has been alleged in the expense
with which an establishment such as
New South Wales would cost. It is
worthy of remark, however, that from
1789 to the end of 1821, England had
expended for the transport, maintenance,
and other charges of 33,155 convicts,
transported to New South Wales,
&pound;5,301,023, being <i>scarce a third</i> of what
the prisoners would have cost in the
prisons of Great Britain, without having
the satisfaction of having changed into
useful citizens those who were the shame
and terror of society.</p>

<p>"When a vessel with convicts on
board arrives in the colony, the men who
are not married in it, are permitted to
choose a wife among the female convicts.
At the expiration of his term of punishment,
every convict is at liberty to return
to his own country, at his own expense.
If he chooses to remain, he obtains a grant
of land, and provisions for 18 months:
if he is married the allotment is larger,
and an adequate portion is allowed for
each child. Numbers are provided with
the means of emigration at the expense
of government; they obtain 150 acres of
land, seed-corn, and implements of husbandry.
It is worthy of remark that,
thanks to the vigilance of the authorities,
the transported in that colony lose their
depraved habits; that the women become
well behaved and fruitful; and that the
children do not inherit the vices of their
parents. These results are sufficient to
place the colony of New South Wales
<i>among the most noble philanthropic institutions
in the world</i>. After that, can
any one ask the expense of the establishment?"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Malte-Brun</span>,
<i>G&eacute;ographie Universelle</i>, xii. 194-196.</p></blockquote>

<p>But here a fresh difficulty arises.
Granting, it will be said, that transportation
is so immense a benefit to
the mother country, in affording a
safe and certain vent for its criminals;
and to the colonies, by providing
them with so ample a supply of forced
labour, what is to be done when they
will not receive it? The colonies are
all up in arms against transportation;
not one can be persuaded, on any terms,
to receive these convicts. When a
ship with convicts arrives, they begin
talking about separation and independence,
and reminding us of Bunker's
Hill and Saratoga. The Cape
shows us with what feelings colonies
which have not yet received them
view the introduction of criminals;
Van Diemen's Land, how well founded
their apprehensions are of the consequences
of such an invasion of civilised
depravity. This difficulty, at
first sight, appears not only serious
but insurmountable. On a nearer
examination, however, it will be
found that, however formidable it
may appear, it could easily be got
over; and that it is entirely owing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>to the true principles of transportation
having been forgotten, and one of the
first duties of government neglected
by our rulers for the last thirty years.</p>

<p>It is very remarkable, and throws
an important light on this question,
that this horror at the influx of
convicts, which has now become so
general in the colonies as to render it
almost impossible to find a place
where they can with safety be landed,
is entirely of <i>recent</i> origin. It never
was heard of till within the last
fifteen or twenty years. Previous
to that time, and even much later,
transportation was not only regarded
by the penal colonies without aversion,
but with the utmost possible
complacency. They looked to a
series of heavy assizes in Great
Britain with the same feelings of
anxious solicitude, as the working
classes do to a good harvest, or the
London tradesman to a gay and
money-spending season. Spirits never
were so high in Sidney, speculation
never so rife, property never so valuable,
profits never so certain, as when
the convict ships arrived well stored
with compulsory emigrants. If any
one doubts this, let him open the early
numbers of the <i>Colonial Magazine</i>,
and he will find them filled with resolutions
of public meetings in New
South Wales, recounting the immense
advantages the colony had derived
from the forced labour of convicts,
and most earnestly deprecating any
intermission in their introduction.
As a specimen, we subjoin a series of
resolutions, by the Governor and
Council of New South Wales, on a
petition agreed to, at a public meeting
held in Sidney, on 18th February
1838.</p>

<blockquote>

<h3><i>Resolutions of the Legislative Council, New
South Wales, 17th July 1838.</i></h3>

<p>4. <i>Resolved.</i>&mdash;That, in opinion of this
council, the numerous free emigrants of
character and capital, including many
officers of the army and navy, and East
India Company's service, who have settled
in this colony, with their families,
together with a rising generation of
native-born subjects, constitute a body of
colonists who, in the exercise of the
social and moral relations of life, are not
inferior to the inhabitants of any other
dependency of the British crown, and
are sufficient to impress a character of
respectability upon the colony at large.</p>

<p>5. <i>Resolved.</i>&mdash;That, in the opinion of
this council, the rapid and increasing
advance of this colony, in the short space
of fifty years from its first establishment,
in rural, commercial, and financial prosperity,
proves indisputably the activity,
the enterprise, and industry of the colonists,
and is wholly incompatible with
the state of society represented to exist
here.</p>

<p>6. <i>Resolved.</i>&mdash;That, in the opinion of
this council, the strong desire manifested
by the colonists generally, to obtain
moral and religious instruction, and the
liberal contributions, which have been
made from private funds, towards this
most essential object, abundantly testify
that the advancement of virtue and
religion amongst them is regarded with
becoming solicitude.</p>

<p>7. <i>Resolved.</i>&mdash;That, in the opinion of
this council, if transportation and assignment
have hitherto failed to produce all
the good effects anticipated by their
projectors, such failure may be traced to
circumstances, many of which are no
longer in existence, whilst others are in
rapid progress of amendment. Amongst
the most prominent causes of failure may
be adduced the absence, at the first
establishment of the colony, of adequate
religious and moral instruction, and the
want of proper means of classification in
the several gaols throughout the colony,
as well as of a sufficient number of free
emigrants, properly qualified to become
the assignees of convicts, and to be intrusted
with their management and control.</p>

<p>8. <i>Resolved.</i>&mdash;That, in the opinion of
this council, the great extension which
has latterly been afforded of moral and
religious instruction, the classification
which may in future be made in the
numerous gaols now in progress of erection,
upon the most approved principles
of inspection and separation, the most
effectual punishment and classification of
offenders in ironed gangs, according to
their improved system of management&mdash;the
numerous free emigrants now eligible
as the assignees of convicts, and the accumulated
experience of half a century&mdash;form
a combination of circumstances,
which renders the colony better adapted
at the present, than at any former period,
to carry into effect the praiseworthy intentions
of the first founders of the system
of transportation and assignment,
which had no less for its object reformation
of character than a just infliction of
punishment.</p>

<p>9. <i>Resolved.</i>&mdash;That, in the opinion of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
council, no system of penal discipline, or
secondary punishment, will be found at once
so cheap, so effective, and so reformatory,
as that of well-regulated assignment&mdash;the
good conduct of the convict, and his continuance
at labour, being so obviously
the interest of the assignee; whilst the
partial solitude and privations, incidental
to a pastoral or agricultural life in the
remote districts of the colony, (which
may be made the universal employment
of convicts,) by effectually breaking a
connexion with companions and habits
of vice, is better calculated than any
other system to produce moral reformation,
when accompanied by adequate
religious instruction.</p>

<p>10. <i>Resolved.</i>&mdash;That, in the opinion of
this council, many men who, previously
to their conviction, had been brought up
in habits of idleness and vice, have
acquired, by means of assignment, not
only habits of industry and labour, but
the knowledge of a remunerative employment,
which, on becoming free, forms a
strong inducement to continue in an
honest course of life.</p>

<p>11. <i>Resolved.</i>&mdash;That, in the opinion of
this council, the sudden discontinuance of
transportation and assignment, by depriving
the colonists of convict labour, must
necessarily curtail their means of purchasing
crown lands, and, consequently,
the supply of funds for the purpose of
immigration.</p>

<p>12. <i>Resolved.</i>&mdash;That, in the opinion of
this council, the produce of the labour of
convicts, in assignment, is thus one of the
principal, though indirect means, of bringing
into the colony free persons: it is
obvious, therefore, that the continuance
of emigration in any extended form, must
necessarily depend upon the continuance
of the assignment of convicts.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is not surprising that they viewed,
at this period, the transportation system
in this light; for under it they had
made advances in population, comfort,
and riches, unparalleled in any other
age or country of the world.</p>

<p>How, then, has it happened that so
great a change has come over the
views of the colonists on this subject;
and that the system which they formerly
regarded, with reason, as the
sheet-anchor of their prosperity, is
now almost universally looked to
with unqualified aversion, as the certain
forerunner of their destruction?
The answer is easy. It is because
transportation, as formerly conducted,
<i>was a blessing</i>, and because, as conducted
of late years, it <i>has become a
curse</i>, that the change of opinion has
arisen in regard to it. The feelings
of the colonists, in both cases, were
founded on experience&mdash;both were, in
the circumstances in which they arose,
equally well founded, and both were
therefore equally entitled to respect and
attention. We have only to <i>restore
the circumstances</i> in which the convicts
were a blessing, to revive the times
in which their arrival will be regarded
as a boon. And to effect this, can
easily be shown not only to be attended
with no difficulty, but only to
require the simultaneous adoption by
government of a system of punishment
at home, and of voluntary emigration
at the public expense abroad,
attended with a very trifling expense,
and calculated to relieve, beyond any
other measure that could by possibility
be devised, the existing distress
among the labouring classes of
Great Britain and Ireland.</p>

<p>To render the introduction of penal
labour into a colony an advantage,
three things are necessary. 1st, that
the convicts sent out should be for the
most part instructed in some simple
rural art or occupation, of use in the
country into which they are to be
transplanted. 2d, that they should
in general be <i>beginners in crime</i>, and
a small number of them only hardened
in depravity. 3d, what is most important
of all, that they should be preserved
in a <i>due proportion</i>, never exceeding
<i>a fourth or a fifth</i> to the free and
untainted settlers. Under these conditions,
their introduction will always
prove a blessing, and will be hailed as
a boon. If they are neglected, they
will prove a curse, and their arrival
be regarded as a punishment.</p>

<p>Various circumstances have contributed,
of late years, to render the
convict system a dreadful evil, instead
of, as formerly, a signal benefit to the
colonies. But that affords no ground
for despair; on the contrary, it furnishes
the most well-grounded reason
for hope. We are suffering under the
effects of an erroneous regimen, not
any inherent malady in the patient.
Change this treatment, and his health
will soon return.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span></p>
<p>It is well known that the greatest
pains have of <i>late years</i> been taken, in
this country, to instruct prisoners in
jail in some useful handicraft; and
that, so far has this been carried, that
our best-regulated jails are more in
fact great houses of industry. The
general penitentiary at Pentonville,
in particular, where the convicts sentenced
to transportation are trained,
previous to their removal to the penal
settlements, is a perfect model of
arrangement and attention in this important
respect. But it is equally
well known that it is only of <i>late</i> years
that this signal reform has come into
operation; and we have the satisfaction
of knowing that already its
salutary effects have been evinced,
in the most signal manner, with the
convicts sent abroad. Previous to the
year 1840, scarcely anything was done
on any considerable scale, either to
teach ordinary prisoners trades in jail,
to separate them from each other, or
to prepare them, in the public penitentiaries,
for the duties in which they
were to be engaged, when they arrived
at their distant destination. The
county jails, now resounding with the
clang of ceaseless occupation, pursued
by prisoners in their separate cells,
then only re-echoed the din of riot and
revelling in the day-rooms where the
idle prisoners were huddled together,
and beguiled the weary hours of their
captivity by stories of perpetrated
crime, or plans for its renewal the
moment they got out of confinement.
But the ideas of men are all formed
on the experience of facts, or the
thoughts driven into them, for a considerable
time back. The present
universal horror at transportation is
founded on the experience of the prisoners
with which, for a quarter of a
century, New South Wales had been
flooded, from the idle day-rooms or profligate
hulks of Great Britain. Some
years must elapse before the effects
of the improved discipline received,
and laborious habits acquired, in the
jails and penitentiaries of the mother
country, produces any general effect on
public opinion in its distant colonies.</p>

<p>The relaxation of the severity of
our penal code at home, during the
last thirty years, however loudly
called for by considerations of justice
and humanity, has undoubtedly had
a most pernicious influence on the
<i>class of convicts</i> who have, during that
period, been sent to the colonies. In
so far as that change of system has
diminished the frequency of the infliction
of the punishment of death,
and limited, practically speaking, that
dreadful penalty to cases of wilful
and inexcusable murder, it must command
the assent of every benevolent
and well-regulated mind. But, unfortunately,
the change has not stopped
there. It has descended through
every department of our criminal
jurisprudence, and come in that way
to alter much for the worse <i>the class
of criminals</i> who of late years have
been sent to the penal colonies. The
men who were formerly hanged are
now for the most part transported;
those formerly transported are now
imprisoned; and those sent abroad
have almost all, on repeated occasions,
been previously confined, generally for
a very long period. As imprisonment
scarcely ever works any reformation
on the <i>moral</i> character or habits of a
prisoner, whatever improved skill in
handicraft it may put into his fingers,
this change has been attended with
most serious and pernicious effect on
the character of the convicts sent to
the colonies, and gone far to produce
the aversion with which they are now
everywhere regarded.</p>

<p>It has been often observed, by those
practically acquainted with the working
of the transportation system in
the colonies, that the Irish convicts
were generally the best, and the
Scotch, beyond all question, the worst
who arrived. This peculiarity, so
widely different from, in fact precisely
the reverse of, what has been observed
of the <i>free</i> settlers from these respective
countries, in every part of the
world, has frequently been made the
subject of remark, and excited no
little surprise. But the reason of it
is evident, and, when once stated,
perfectly satisfactory. The Scotch
law, administered almost entirely by
professional men, and on fixed principles,
has long been based on the
principle of transporting persons only
who were deemed irreclaimable in
this country. Very few have been
sent abroad for half a century, from
Scotland, who had not either committed
some very grave offence, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
been four or five times, often eight or
ten times, previously convicted and
imprisoned. In Ireland, under the
moderate and lenient sway of Irish
county justices, a poacher was often
transported who had merely been
caught with a hare tucked up under
his coat. Whatever we may think of
the justice of such severe punishments
for trivial offences, in the first instance,
there can be but one opinion as to its
tendency to lead a much better class
of convicts from the Emerald Isle, than
the opposite system did from the
shores of Caledonia. Very probably,
also, the system of giving prisoners
"repeated opportunities of amendment,"
as it is called in this country&mdash;but
which, in fact, would be more aptly
styled "renewed opportunities for
depravity"&mdash;has, from good but mistaken
motives, been carried much too
far in Scotland. Be this as it may,
nothing is more certain than that the
substitution of a race of repeatedly
convicted and hardened offenders,
under the milder system of punishment
in Great Britain, during the last
twenty years, for one comparatively
uninitiated in crime, such as were
formerly sent out, has had a most
pernicious effect on the character of
the convicts received in the colonies,
and the sentiments with which their
arrival was regarded.</p>

<p>But by far the most powerful cause,
which has been in operation for above
a quarter of a century, in destroying
the beneficial effects of the system of
transportation, and substituting the
worst possible consequences in their
stead, has been the sending out of convicts
<i>in too great a proportion to the free
population</i>, and the consequent necessity
for substituting the <i>gang for the
assignment system</i>. This is a matter of
the very highest, indeed of paramount
importance; and it may safely be
affirmed that, unless a remedy is found
for it, all efforts made to render the
system of transportation palatable to
the colonies will prove nugatory.
Fortunately the means of remedying
that evil are not only easy, but, comparatively
speaking, cheap, and perfectly
efficacious; and they promise,
while they remedy the above-mentioned
evil, to confer, in other respects,
signal benefits both on the colonies and
the mother country.</p>

<p>New South Wales was originally
selected, and not without sufficient
reasons, as the place for the establishment
of penal colonies, because the
distance of it from the mother country,
and the length of the voyage, rendered
it a very difficult matter either
for runaway convicts, or those who
had served their time, to get home
again. Once sent out, you were, in
the great majority of cases, clear of
them for ever. This circumstance
was no disadvantage, but rather the
reverse, to the colony, and certainly a
very great advantage to the parent
state, as long as the number of convicts
annually sent out was inconsiderable,
and the whole convict population
formed a small minority to the
number of free settlers. When the
whole number committed a-year in
England was 4500, and in Scotland
under 100, as it was in Great Britain
in 1804 or 1805, the settlement of
convicts on the distant shores of
Australia worked well. They were
glad to get the 300 or 400 annually
sent out; they were benefited by
their forced labour; and the free
settlers were in sufficient numbers
to keep them with ease in subjection,
and prevent their habits from contaminating
those of the free inhabitants
of the colony. But when the
commitments from Great Britain and
Ireland had risen to 50,000 or 60,000
a-year, and the convicts sent out to
3000 or 4000 annually, as they have
done for some years past, the case
was entirely altered. The polluted
stream became much too large and
powerful for the land it was intended
to fertilise; it did more harm than
good, and became the object of uniform
and undisguised aversion.</p>

<p>The <i>distance</i> of Australia from the
mother country, which formerly had
been so great an advantage to both
parties, now became the greatest
possible evil; because it prevented, at
the time this great influx of convicts
was going on, the immigration of
freemen from preserving anything like
a due proportion to it. When the convicts
rose to 2000 and 3000 yearly, the
free settlers should have been raised
to 8000 or 10,000 annually. This
would have kept all right; because
the tainted population would have
been always in a small minority com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>pared
to the virtuous; order would
have been preserved by the decided
majority of the well-disposed; and the
assignment system, the parent of so
much good, still rendered practicable by
the ceaseless extension of free settlers
in the wilds of nature. But the
distance of Australia rendered this
impracticable, when the emigration
of freemen was left to its own unaided
resources. Steam navigation
contributed powerfully to throw it into
the back-ground for all but the very
highest class of emigrants. The voyage
to Australia is one of fourteen
thousand miles; it takes from five to
six months, must still be performed
by sailing vessels, and costs about
&pound;16 a-head for the ordinary class of
emigrants. That to America is one of
three thousand miles; it takes from a
fortnight to three weeks, is performed
by great numbers of steam as well as
sailing vessels, and costs from &pound;3 to
&pound;4 a-head for the same class of passengers.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>These facts are decisive, and must
always continue so, against the choice
of Australia, as the place of their destination,
by the great bulk of ordinary
emigrants. Several young men of
good family, indeed, tempted by the
high profits generally made there in
the wool trade, and the boundless facilities
for the multiplication of flocks
which its prairies afforded, have settled
there, and some have done well.
But of ordinary labourers, and persons
to do the work of common workmen,
there has always been felt a very great
deficiency, for this simple reason, that
they could not afford the expense of
the voyage. The settlers were almost
entirely of the better class, and they
were in no proportion at all to the
number of the convicts. This distinctly
appears, not only from the extravagant
wages paid to shepherds
and common labourers, generally not
less than five or six shillings a-day,
but from the very limited number of
emigrants, even during the distress
of the last three years, when the voluntary
emigration had reached two
hundred and fifty thousand annually
from the British islands, who have
gone to our colonies in New South
Wales.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>This unhappy turn of affairs has
been attended with a double disadvantage.
In the first place, the vast
increase in the number of convicts
sent to Sydney, compared with the
small number of free settlers, has for a
long time past rendered the continuance
of the assignment system impossible;
and <i>the gang system</i>, to take off
and embody the surplus numbers,
became in a manner a matter of necessity.
The manners of the colony, its
habits, its prospects, its morality, have
been seriously damaged by this change.
The emancipated convicts who have
made money, known by the name of
"canary birds," have pressed upon
the heels, and come to excite the
jealousy, of the free settlers. The
accumulation of convicts in the lower
walks of life has checked the immigration
of free labour, perpetuated the
frightful inequality of the sexes, and
led to the most lamentable disorders.
The gang system, of necessity introduced,
because free settlers did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>exist to take the convicts off under the
assignment system, perpetuated in the
colony the vices of the hulks, the
depravity of the galleys. The whole
benefits of transportation to the convicts,
their whole chances of amendment,
are lost, when, instead of being
sent to rural labour in the solitude of
the woods and the prairies, they are
huddled together, in gangs of four
or five hundred, without hope to
counterbalance evil propensities, or
inducement to resist the seduction of
mutual bad example. These evils
were so sensibly felt, and led to such
energetic representations to the government
at home, that at length the
colony was pacified, but at the same
time its progress checked, by an order
in council in 1837, that no more convicts,
for a limited time, should be
sent to Sydney or its dependencies.</p>

<p>But this only shifted the seat of the
evil, and augmented its intensity. The
convicts, now swelled to above four
thousand a-year, could not be kept at
home; they required to be sent somewhere,
and where was that place to
be? Van Diemen's Land was selected,
being the most southernly portion
of New Holland, and of course the
farthest removed from this country;
and thither nearly the <i>whole convicts</i>
of Great Britain and Ireland, soon
above thirty-five hundred annually in
number, were sent for several years.
The consequence of this prodigious influx
of criminals into an infant colony,
so far removed from the parent state
that it cost &pound;20 a-head to send a
common labourer there&mdash;and of course
no free emigration in proportionate
numbers could be expected without
public aid&mdash;might easily have been
anticipated. Government did nothing
to encourage the simultaneous settlement
of free settlers in that distant
land, thus flooded with convicts, or
so little as amounted to nothing.
The consequence was, that, ere long,
<i>three-fifths</i> of the inhabitants of the
colony were convicts. Every one
knows, none could have failed to anticipate
the consequences. The morals
of the settlement, thus having a majority
of its inhabitants convicts, were
essentially injured. Crimes unutterable
were committed; the hideous
inequality of the sexes induced its
usual and frightful disorders; the
police, how severe and vigilant soever,
became unable to coerce the rapidly-increasing
multitude of criminals; the
most daring fled to the woods, where
they became bush-rangers; life became
insecure; property sank to half
its former value. So powerful, and
evidently well-founded, were the representations
made on the subject to
the legislature, that it became evident
that a remedy must be applied; and
this was done by an order in council
in 1844, which suspended entirely for
two years the transportation of <i>male</i>
convicts to the colonies. That of
females was still and most properly continued,
in the hope that, by doing so,
the inequality of the sexes in Australia
might in some degree be corrected.</p>

<p>But this measure, like all the rest,
not being founded on the right principle,
has entirely failed. The accumulation
of offenders in the British
islands, from the stoppage of the usual
vent by which they were formerly
carried off, soon became insupportable.
The jails were crowded to suffocation;
it was ere long found to be
necessary to liberate many persons,
transported seven years, at the expiration
of two, to make way for new
inmates. The liberated convicts were
soon back in their old haunts, and at
their old practices; and the great increase
of <i>serious</i> crimes, such as robberies,
burglaries, and murders, demonstrated
that the public morals in
the great towns were rapidly giving
way, under the influence of that worst
species of criminals&mdash;returned convicts.
The judges both of Great Britain and
Ireland, in common with every person
practically acquainted with the subject,
and who had daily proofs, in the discharge
of their important official duties,
of the total failure of the imprisonment
system, were unanimous in recommending
a return to transportation.
All the temporary expedients adopted,
such as Gibraltar, Bermuda, &amp;c., soon
failed from the rapid increase of convicts,
who greatly exceeded all the
means left of taking them off. Government
became convinced that they had
made a step in the wrong direction;
and they most wisely took counsel from
experience, and determined to resume
the practice of sending convicts abroad.
But, on the threshold of the renewed
attempt, they were met by the refusal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
of the colonies to take them. The Cape
is almost in rebellion on the subject;
and in despair of finding a willing
colony, it is said they have in contemplation
to send them to be roasted
under the White Cliffs, and increase
the already redundant population of
Malta.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to do any such
thing. The solution of the transportation
question is easy, the method
to be followed perfectly efficacious.
Government have only <i>to commence
the discharge</i> of one of their most important
social duties to get rid of all
their difficulties, and render the immigration
of criminals, as it was in time
past, as great a blessing to the colonies,
and as ardently desired, as of late
years it has been a curse, and earnestly
deprecated.</p>

<p>Transportation is a blessing to a colony
when the convicts are kept in a minority,
perhaps in a fourth or a fifth of
the community to which they are sent,
and when they are not hardened in
crime, and all instructed in some useful
trade. In such circumstances, they
are the greatest possible addition to
its strength, riches, and progress, and
will always be gladly received.</p>

<p>Transportation is a curse when the
convicts sent out are so numerous,
and the free settlers so few, that the
former forms a large proportion of the
community compared to the latter, and
when their habits are those of hardened
irreclaimable criminals, instead of
youthful novices in crime. If they
become a majority, certain ruin may
be anticipated to the colony thus
flooded with crime.</p>

<p>The difficulties which now beset the
transportation question have all
arisen from our having pursued a
course, of late years, which rendered
the settlement of convicts a curse instead
of a blessing, as it was at first,
when the system was directly the
reverse. To render it a blessing
again, we have only to restore the
circumstances which made it so formerly&mdash;sending
out the convicts when
not completely hardened in depravity,
and in such a proportion to the free
settlers as to keep them a <i>small minority</i>
to the free and untainted part of
the community. The immigration of
convicts to our colonies is like that of
the Irish into western Britain: everything
depends on the proportion they
bear to the remainder of the population.
They are very useful if a fourth;
they can be borne if they are a third;
but let them become a majority, and
they will soon land the country in the
condition of Skibbereen or Connemara.</p>

<p>We cannot diminish the numbers
of convicts transported; on the contrary,
woful results have made us
aware that it should be materially increased.
Experience has taught us,
also, that voluntary unaided emigration
cannot enable the free settlers in
Australia to keep pace with the rapid
increase of crime in the British islands.
What, then, is to be done? The answer
is simple: Discharge in part the
vast duty, so long neglected by government,
of providing, at the public expense,
for the emigration of a certain
portion of the <i>most indigent</i> part of the
community, who cannot get abroad
on their own resources, and <span class="smcap">SETTLE
THEM IN THE SAME COLONY WITH THE
CONVICTS</span>. Do this, and the labour
market is lightened at home; the convicts
are kept in a small minority
abroad; the colony, thus aided by the
combined virtue and penal labour of
the mother country, is secured of prosperity
and rapid progress; and its
rate of increase will soon induce the
other colonies to petition for a share
of the prolific stream.</p>

<p>At present, there are, or at least
should be, above 5000 criminals annually
transported from the British
islands.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The cost of settling a free
labourer in Australia is about &pound;16
a-head. To send 16,000 free labourers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>with these 5000 criminals would
cost just &pound;256,000 a-year: call it
&pound;300,000 yearly, to make room for
the probable increase of criminals,
from the growing necessities or depravity
of the mother country, and
provide for the extra and unavoidable
expenses of an infant establishment,
and the transportation question is at
once solved, a great relief is afforded
to the distressed labourers of the
parent state, and a certain market for
our manufactures provided, which will
double every two or three years, as
long as the system is continued.</p>

<p>Let government, by an order in
council, propose these terms to the
colonies, and we shall see if any of
them will refuse them. If none will
close with them, let them at once
establish a new colony on these principles,
in some unoccupied part of
New Holland. In twelve months,
there will be a race for who is to get
a share of the fertilising stream. Sixteen
thousand free settlers, and five or
six thousand convicts, annually sent
to any colony, would cause its numbers
to double every two, and its
prosperity to triple in value every
three years. Everything would go
on in a geometrical progression. It
would soon rival California in progress
and reputation. Capital would rapidly
follow this scene of activity and progress.
Moneyed men are not slow in discovering
where labour is plentiful and
comparatively cheap, and where their
investments are doubled in amount
and value every two or three years.
A colony thus powerfully supported
by the parent state would soon distance
all its competitors: while the
Cape, New Zealand, and Australia
were slumbering on with a population
doubling every ten years, from the
tardy and feeble support of free emigrants
on their own resources, the
establishment thus protected would
double in two or three. Voluntary
emigrants would crowd to the
scene of activity, progress, and opulence.
The 20,000 persons annually
sent out would immediately become
consumers of our manufactures to the
extent of &pound;150,000 a-year:<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and this
rate would be doubled the very next
year! At the end of five or six years,
it would amount to &pound;800,000 or
&pound;900,000 annually. What a relief at
once to the manufacturers of Great
Britain, now labouring so severely
under the combined effect of foreign
competition and a declining home
market, and the starving peasantry
of Ireland, where half a million of
stout labourers&mdash;admirable workmen
in a foreign country, though wretched
ones in their own&mdash;are pining in hopeless
destitution, a burden upon their
parishes, or flocking in ruinous multitudes
to Liverpool and Glasgow.</p>

<p>But where is the &pound;300,000 to come
from? The Chancellor of the Exchequer
has no money; taxation has
reached its limits; and loans are out
of the question. What! have free
trade and a restricted currency, then,
so quickly prostrated the resources of
the country, that the nation which, in
1813, with eighteen millions of inhabitants,
at the close of a twenty
years' costly war, raised &pound;72,000,000
by taxation, and &pound;80,000,000 by loan,
cannot now, with thirty millions, for
so very important an object, after
thirty-three years of unbroken peace,
muster up &pound;300,000 a-year? A shilling
a gallon on the 6,259,000 gallons
of whisky annually consumed in <i>Scotland
alone</i>, in demoralising the community,
would provide the requisite
sum, and tend to equalise the ruinous
exemption which Scotland now enjoys
in the manufacture of that attractive
and pernicious liquor. A similar duty
on the 12,000,000 gallons annually
consumed in England, would raise
double the sum. But if government,
despite the &pound;100,000,000 we were
promised by free trade, cannot afford
&pound;300,000 a-year for this vital object,
let it be laid on the counties as part
of the prison or county rates. A little
reflection would soon show every
person of sense in the country, that
its amount could speedily be saved in
prison and poor rates.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with this change, an
alteration, equally loudly called for,
should take place in the administration
of our criminal law at home.
The present system of inflicting short
imprisonments at first, and reserving
long imprisonments and transportation
for criminals who have plied their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>trade of pillage for two or three years,
should be abolished. Imprisonment
should consist of three kinds:&mdash;1. A
very short imprisonment, perhaps of
a week or ten days, for the youngest
criminals and a first trifling offence,
intended to terrify merely. 2. For a
second offence, however trivial&mdash;or a
first, if considerable, and indicating
an association with professional
thieves&mdash;a long imprisonment of <i>nine
months or a year</i>, sufficient <i>to teach
every one a trade</i>, should invariably be
inflicted. 3. The criminal who has
been thus imprisoned, and taught a
trade, should, when next convicted,
be <i>instantly transported</i>. In this way
a triple advantage would be gained.
1. The immense number of prisoners
now constantly in confinement in the
British islands would be materially
lessened, and the prison-rates proportionally
relieved. 2. The cost of now
maintaining a convict in one of the
public penitentiaries, to prepare him
for transportation, not less than &pound;17
or &pound;18, would be almost entirely
saved; he would be prepared for it,
in the great majority of cases, by his
previous imprisonment. 3. The character
and habits of the convicts sent
out would be materially improved,
by getting comparatively young and
untainted men for penal labour, instead
of old offenders, who have learned
no other trade than that of thieving.
To the country it would undoubtedly
save &pound;60 or &pound;80 on each criminal
transported, by removing him at the
commencement of his career, when
his reformation was possible, instead
of waiting till its close, when he had
lived for three or four years in flash-houses
and prisons at the public expense,
paid in depredations or prison
rates, and acquired nothing but habits
which rendered any change of character
abroad difficult, if not impossible.
The prisons would become,
instead of mere receptacles of vice,
great houses of industry, where the
most dangerous and burdensome part
of our population would be trained
for a life of industry and utility in the
colonies.</p>

<p>For a similar reason, the great object
in poor-houses, houses of refuge,
hospitals, and other institutions where
the destitute poor children are maintained
at the public expense, or that
of foundations bequeathed by the
piety of former times, should be to
prepare the young of both sexes, by
previous education, for the habits and
duties of colonists; and, when they
become adults, to <i>send them abroad at
the expense of the public or the institution</i>.
Incalculable would be the
blessings which would ensue, both to
the public morals and the public expenditure,
from the steady adoption
of this principle. It is a lamentable
fact, well known to all practically
acquainted with this subject, that a
large proportion of the orphan or destitute
boys, educated in this manner
at the public expense, in public institutions,
become thieves, and nearly
all the girls prostitutes. It could not
be otherwise with young creatures of
both sexes, turned out without a
home, relation, or friend, shortly after
the age of puberty, into the midst of
an old and luxurious community,
overloaded with labour, abounding in
snares, thickly beset with temptations.
Removed to Australia, the Cape, or
Canada, they might do well, and
would prove as great a blessing in
those colonies, where labour is dear,
women wanted, and land boundless,
as they are a burden here, where labour
is cheap, women redundant, and
land all occupied. Every shilling laid
out in the training the youth of both
sexes in such situations, for the duties
of colonial life, and sending them to it
when adults, would save three in future
prison or poor rates. A pauper
or criminal, costing the nation &pound;15 or
&pound;20 a-year, would be converted into
an independent man living on his
labour, and consuming &pound;7 or &pound;8 worth
yearly of the manufactures of his native
country.</p>

<p>The number of emigrants who now
annually leave the British shores, is
above 250,000!<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> No such migration
of mankind is on record since the days
when the Goths and Vandals overthrew
the Roman empire, and settled
amidst its ruins. It might naturally
have been supposed that so prodigious
a removal of persons, most of them in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>the prime of life, would have contributed
in a material degree to lighten
the market of labour, and lessen the
number of persons who, by idleness
or desperation, are thrown into habits
of crime. But the result has been
just the reverse; and perhaps nothing
has contributed so powerfully to increase
crime, and augment destitution
among the labouring classes of late
years, as this very emigration. The
reason is evident. It is for the most
part <i>the wrong class which has gone
abroad</i>. It is the employer, not the
employed; the holders of little capitals,
not the holders of none. Left to
its own unaided resources, emigration
could be undertaken only by persons
possessed of some funds to pay their
passage. It took &pound;100 to transport
a family to Australia; &pound;20 or &pound;30 to
America. The destitute, the insolvent,
the helpless, could not get away,
and they fell in overwhelming and
crushing multitudes on the parish
funds, county rates, and charity of
the benevolent at home. Labour became
everywhere redundant, because
so many of the employers of labour
had gone away. The grand object
for all real lovers of their country
now, should be to induce government
or the counties to provide means for
the emigration, on a large scale, of
destitute <i>labourers</i>, chained by their
poverty to the soil. About 150,000
persons have annually emigrated from
Ireland for the last three years,
carrying with them above half its
agricultural capital; and the consequence
is, that in many districts the
land is uncultivated, <i>and the banknotes
in circulation, which, in 1846,
were &pound;7,500,000, have sunk in August
1849 to &pound;3,833,000</i>!<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The small
cultivators, the employers of the poor,
have disappeared, and with them their
capital&mdash;leaving only to the owners
of land a crowd of starving, unemployed
labourers, to consume their
rents. A million of such starving
labourers now oppress the industry of
Ireland. Such is the result of agitation
at home, and free trade in emigration
abroad. The American papers
tell us, that each of these starving
Irishmen, if strong and healthy, is
worth 1000 dollars to the United
States. Free-trade emigration can
never send them out&mdash;it can transport
only those who can pay. A large
increase of penal emigration, coupled
with such a proportionate influx, at
the public expense, of free settlers, as
would prevent it from becoming an
evil, at once solves the transportation
question, and is the first step in the
right direction in that of Emigration.</p>

<h2><a name="MY_PENINSULAR_MEDAL" id="MY_PENINSULAR_MEDAL">MY PENINSULAR MEDAL.</a></h2>

<p class="center">BY AN OLD PENINSULAR.</p>


<h3>PART I.&mdash;CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p>On the evening of the 13th of February
last, I was sitting in my library,
at my residence in &mdash;&mdash; Square, when
a double knock at the door announced
the postman. Betty presently entered,
bringing, not as I anticipated, a letter
or two, but a small packet, which
evidently excited her curiosity, as it
did mine.</p>

<p>The first thing upon the said packet
that caught my eye was a large seal
of red wax&mdash;the royal arms!&mdash;then,
above the direction, "On Her Majesty's
service!"&mdash;just beneath, the word,
"Medal!" Yes, the medal that I
had earned five-and-thirty years before,
in the hard-fought fight on the
hill of Toulouse&mdash;long expected, it
was come at last! And, let me tell
you, a very handsome medal, too;
well designed, well executed; and
accompanied with a very civil letter,
from that old soldier, and true soldier's
friend, Lord Fitzroy Somerset, the
military secretary. This letter being,
no doubt, precisely the same as hundreds
of "Old Peninsulars" have by
this time received, I presume I am
guilty of no breach of confidence in
here transcribing it for the benefit of
my readers:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Horse-Guards, 31st January 1849.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sir,&mdash;I am directed by the Commander-in-Chief
to transmit to you
the Medal and Clasps graciously
awarded to you by her Majesty under
the general order of the first of June
1847. I have the honour to be, &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p class="marleft20">
"<span class="smcap">Fitzroy Somerset</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>As I never attempt to describe
my own feelings, except such as are
describable, I shall not relate what I
now felt on the receipt of this much
desired, anxiously expected medal.
But this I will say;&mdash;long live the
Queen! long live Queen Victoria!
God bless her! Oh, it was a kind
thought: it was a gracious act. It
comes to cheer the heart of many an
old soldier, and of many a middle-aged
gentleman like myself, who got nothing
but honour and aching bones
for his share in the Peninsular glories;
and now has something that he can
add to the archives of his family, and
leave to those who come after him.
"Graciously awarded to you by her
Majesty:" Yes; and I feel it as much
so, as if her Majesty's own gracious
hands had placed it in mine. And, if
ever she wants defenders, so long as
this arm can wield&mdash;but enough:
romance would be out of place.</p>

<p>After the delivery of the medals
had been proceeding for some time, I
was coming, one morning, out of the
Horse-Guards, when I met old Major
Snaffle, who had just got his. The
major belongs to that class who are
known in the army by the name of
"grumblers;" and, having been
knocked down by the wind of a shot
at the Trocadero, having been brought
away in the last boat but nineteen
from Corunna, having seen the battle
of Salamanca from the top of a tree,
having been seized with the ague but
an hour before the storming of Badajoz,
having again been very ill in the
south of France from eating unripe
grapes, having regularly drawn his
pay and allowances, and never having
been absent from his regiment on sick
leave when he could not get it, now
justly deems himself a very ill-used
man, because more has not been done
for him. "Well, major," said I, "I
wish you joy. So you have got your
medal at last." "Yes," growled the
major, or rather grunted, "at last I
<i>have</i> got it. Long time, though, six-and-thirty
years&mdash;long time to wait
for half-a-crown."</p>

<p>My own profession, at present, is
very different from that of arms.
Nor can I presume, having been in
but one general action, to rank with
those brave old fire-eaters of the Peninsular
army, whose medals with
<i>many</i> clasps&mdash;bar above bar&mdash;tell of
six, seven, eight, critical combats or
more, in which they took a part under
the illustrious Wellington, in Portu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>gal,
in Spain, in the south of France.
By the bye, how I should like to see
the Duke's own medal! What a lot
of bars <span class="smcap">HE</span> must have!&mdash;what a glorious
ladder, step rising above step in
regular succession, when he sits down
to soup in his field-marshal's coat!
But I was going to say&mdash;to return
from great things to small&mdash;so far
from being able to claim high military
honours for myself, though serving
under his Grace's orders in the Peninsular
war, I was not there at all in a
strictly military capacity. Yet as,
from this very circumstance, I had
opportunities of seeing scenes, characters,
and incidents, connected with
the British army, of a different kind
from those described by other writers
on the subject, I am induced, by the
arrival of my medal, to place on record
a short narrative of my personal adventures
in the Peninsula and south
of France.</p>

<p>Yet, ere I commence the yarn, a
word, one word, for the honoured
dead. Many, who came home
safe from the Peninsula, fell at
Waterloo. Others were borne from
the western ports of Europe across
the Atlantic, to be marks for Kentucky
riflemen and New England
bushfighters. Of the survivors, multitudes
upon multitudes have gradually
dropped off; and those who now remain,
of the legions that conquered at
Vimeira, at Vittoria, and at Orthes,
to receive her Majesty's gracious
gift, are probably fewer in number
than those who are gone. One "Old
Peninsular" I have heard of, in whose
own family and connexions, had all
lived, there would have been fourteen
or fifteen claimants of the medal. He
is now, if he still survives, the only
one left. In my own connexions we
should have made seven; and now,
besides myself, there remains only
one venerable uncle, who is comfortably
located in a snug berth in Canada.
There was my honoured father, who
received the thanks of parliament for
his services at Corunna, and pounded
the French batteries at Cadiz. There
was my cousin, Tom Impett, of the
53d, whom I found with a musket-ball
in his leg two days after the
battle of Toulouse, in a house full of
wounded men and officers. He died
in Canada. There was another venerable
uncle, as kind an uncle as ever
breathed, and as honest a man as
ever lived. He died, to his honour,
far from rich, after having been personally
responsible for millions upon
millions of public money, the sinews
of war, all paid away in hard cash for
our Peninsular expenses. He was generally
known at headquarters by a
comical modification of his two Christian
names. There was Captain, afterwards
Colonel B&mdash;&mdash;, of the Royal
Engineers, a quiet, mild-tempered
man, with military ardour glowing in
his breast&mdash;the man of education and
the gentleman. We met near the
platform of St Cyprien; and he had
the kindness to entertain me with a
calm disquisition on the fight, while
we were both in the thick of it. He
had his share of professional employment
in the Peninsular sieges, and got
a bad wound or two; but lived to
fortify Spike Island, and was at length
lost at sea. And then there was colonel
H&mdash;&mdash;, who commanded a Portuguese
brigade with the rank of brigadier-general&mdash;an
extraordinary composition
of waggery, shrewdness, chivalry,
and professional talent. He
came down to Lisbon while I was
there, on his way to England, quite
worn out with hard service and the
effect of his wounds, or, as he told us
himself, "unripped at every seam."
He died not many days after, on his
passage to England.</p>

<p>Now for myself. I commenced
keeping my terms at Trinity College,
Cambridge, in the year 1809, the
seventeenth of my age. A college
life was not altogether my own choice;
for nearly all the males of my family,
for three generations, had served or
were serving their country either in
the army, navy, or marines, to the
number of some ten or twelve; and I
myself had always looked forward to
wearing the king's uniform. Moreover,
as the Peninsular war had already
commenced when I went to college,
and I had learned at school the
use of the broadsword and small
sword, had been drilled, and could
handle a musket, my thoughts often
turned to military scenes, especially
when I read in the daily journals of
victories won, first by Sir Arthur
Wellesley, then by Lord Wellington.
But, once at Cambridge, I caught the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
fever of academic emulation. My
cousin B&mdash;&mdash; (brother of the Captain
B&mdash;&mdash; above mentioned,) had been
senior wrangler, and had given me
some useful hints as to the mode of
reading with effect; I read hard, obtained
a Trinity scholarship in my first
year, first class the same year, ditto
the second year, and stood fair for a
place among the wranglers. But now
my health broke; not, however, from
hard living, but from hard study. I
was compelled to give up; and, not
choosing to read for a middling degree
after having been booked for a high
one, determined to go out among the
hoys. Now my penchant for military
adventure returned with full force. I
was miserably out of health, with an
excellent constitution&mdash;in proof of
which I always found that I lost
ground by nursing, but gained by a
rough open-air life. A campaign or
two would be just the thing for me.
And I beg to offer this suggestion to
growing young gentlemen who are
sickly, and consequently hipped, as I
was. If, with rough living&mdash;that is,
with much moving about, and constant
exposure to the atmosphere&mdash;you grow
worse, I can give you no comfort; you
are a poor creature, take all the care
of yourself you can. But if, with the
same kind of life, you grow better,
stronger, stouter, heartier, saucier,
depend upon it, you have some stamina.
This was my case. I saw
that a sedentary life was not the life I
was made for; an active life was the
life for me; and my thoughts dwelt
more and more on the Peninsula. I
rubbed up my French, procured a
Gil Blas in Spanish, ditto in Portuguese,
a Portuguese and a Spanish
grammar, and, for a sick man, made
wonderful progress in all the three
languages.</p>

<p>But, alas! there was a hitch. I
was an only son, and an only child&mdash;intended
for the <i>law</i>! My dear father
had already made me a present, while
at school, of Fortescue <i>De Laudibus</i>;
and I had already gobbled up a portion
of that excellent work&mdash;for I was
always an omnivorous reader&mdash;and
had digested it too. And then what
would my dear mother say, if I talked
to her about going to be shot at for
the benefit of my health? It was a
delicate point to manage, and how to
manage it I knew not.</p>

<p>In the long vacation of 1812, which
closed my third year at Trinity College,
Cambridge, I brought matters
to an explanation. My father's
ship, the&mdash;&mdash;, 74, was then in the
Downs, and we had lodgings on Walmer
beach. I stated my desire to
enter the army, and my firm conviction
that nothing else would restore
my shattered constitution. But my
father was inflexible, my mother answered
all my arguments, and I saw
that I had no chance.</p>

<p>But when one way of gaining an
object fails, another sometimes presents
itself. My two uncles, of whom
I have spoken, were already in the
Peninsula, both of them in the same
department, the senior at the head of
it, with the privilege of occasionally
nominating his own clerks. Their
friends in England heard from them
now and then; and I saw a letter
from my senior uncle to a particular
old crony of his own, who had influential
connexions, asking him why he
did not come out to the army with the
rank of A. D. P. M. G.,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> instead of
staying at home, and eating roast pig
for supper.</p>

<p>Like all the hipped, a miserable
race, I was constantly thinking about
myself; and now a happy thought
struck me. As to parliamentary interest,
to be sure I had none. Besides,
being under one-and-twenty, I was
not of an age to aspire to an officer's
rank, in a department of so much responsibility
as the paymaster-general's;
therefore, the above standing
of assistant-deputy, which put an
epaulet on the shoulder at once, was
not to be thought of. But then, if
Buonaparte would only have the kindness
to keep us in hot water two or
three years longer, I might rise to the
said rank by previous good conduct in
the office of clerk, and that my uncle
could get me at once.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span></p>
<p>I again broke ground with my
honoured parents. My father assured
me that, if I went to Lisbon, where he
had been stationed with his ship, I
should find it a hell upon earth:
though I afterwards learned that he
had contrived to spend a tolerably
happy life there. "And as to your
being attached to headquarters, and
following the movements of the army,
I," said he, "have seen quite enough
of service ashore to be able to tell you
that you will be soon sick of that."
But, to cut the story short, my dear
mother now began to incline to my
view of the subject. To be sure a
clerkship was not exactly what they
had thought of for me&mdash;but it might
lead to something better&mdash;no man's
education was complete without a tour
on the Continent&mdash;the usual tour
through France, Italy, and the south
of Germany, was rendered impossible
by the war&mdash;and where, in all Europe,
could a young man travel, except in
Spain and Portugal? Fighting, and
paying those who fought, were different
things&mdash;I might keep out of the
way of bullets, and yet contrive to see
the world. In short, these arguments
prevailed. A letter was written out
to my uncle, begging him to write a
letter to the head office in London,
nominating me as one of his clerks for
Peninsular service. I went back to
Cambridge, attacked Spanish and
Portuguese with renewed ferocity,
took my degree of A. B., and returned
home in the early part of 1813, just in
time to meet a letter from the best of
uncles, stating that he had written to
the home authorities, and was anxiously
expecting my valuable assistance
in the Peninsula.</p>

<p>Nothing was now wanting but the
nomination from London. That anxious
month! Morning after morning I
watched for the postman's knock;
and, at every such summons, it was
myself that opened the door to him.
But great bodies move slowly, and
official dignity delights to announce
itself by tardiness of action. At
length the wished-for communication
arrived; a letter, "On His Majesty's
Service," of no common magnitude;
a seal of correspondent amplitude;
and an intimation, in terms of stately
brevity, that I was appointed a clerk
of the military chest attached to the
Peninsular army, and was to attend
at the office in London to receive my
instructions.</p>

<p>During that month the bustle of
preparation, in our usually quiet domicile,
had been immense. Stockings
sufficient to set up a Cheapside hosier,
shirts enough for a voyage to India,
flannel commensurate with a visit to
the North Pole&mdash;everything, in short,
that could be thought of, was prepared
for the occasion with kind and provident
care. I said farewell, reached
London, reported myself, got my
orders and an advance, booked my
place for Falmouth, and found myself
the same evening a passenger to Exeter
by the fast coach.</p>

<p>In those times, the journey from
London to Falmouth by the fast coach
was a light off-hand affair of two
nights and two days. We reached
Exeter on the second night, and there
I was allowed the indulgence of three
hours' bed, till the Falmouth coach
was ready to start. As part of the
said three hours was occupied in undressing
and dressing, and part also
in saying my prayers, I entered the
new vehicle far more disposed for
sleep than for conversation. But
there I found, to my consternation, a
very chatty passenger, perfectly <i>fresh</i>!
He was a man of universal information&mdash;in
short, a talented individual,
and an intellectual character; had his
own ideas upon morals, politics, theology,
physics, metaphysics, and general
literature; was particularly anxious
to impart them; and was travelling to
obtain orders in the rum and hollands
line. Ah, what a night was that!
Oh the dismal suffering which a prosy
talker inflicts on a weary head! Of all
nuisances, the most unconscious is
the bore. I do think the Speaker of
the House of Commons is the most ill-used
man in the three kingdoms. Reflect:
he must not only hear&mdash;he
must <i>listen</i>! And then think what a
time!&mdash;hour after hour, and day after
day! For a period amounting, in the
aggregate, to no small portion of the
life of man, must that unfortunate victim
of British institutions sit and
hearken to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now a louder, now a weaker,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now a snorter, now a squeaker;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How I pity Mr Speaker!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some portion of such suffering I my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>self
was now compelled to endure, by
my communicative friend in the Falmouth
coach. To be sure, it was
only a single proser; but then there
was variety in one. He commenced
by a few remarks on the weather, by
which he introduced a disquisition on
meteorology. He then passed, by an
easy transition, to the question of
secondary punishments; glanced at
the theory of gravitation; dwelt for
some time on heraldry; touched on
hydrostatics; was large on logarithms;
then digressed on the American war;
proposed emendations of our authorised
version; discussed the Neptunian
theory; and at length suspended
his course, to inform me that I was
decidedly the most agreeable fellow-traveller
he had ever met with. The
fact is, I was sitting up all this time
in the corner of the coach, in a state
of agony and indignation indescribable,
meditating some mode of putting a
stop to the annoyance, and mentally
seeking a solution to the question&mdash;What
right has a very stupid person
to make your brain a thoroughfare
for his stupid ideas, especially when
you would particularly like to go to
sleep? He mistook my silence for
attention, and thought he was appreciated.
This went on till daylight&mdash;continued
to breakfast-time&mdash;proceeded
during breakfast&mdash;ceased not when
we had re-entered the coach-talk,
talk, talk, <i>de omnibus rebus et quibusdam
aliis</i>&mdash;still the same stream of
stuff. That long, that dreary journey
from Exeter to Falmouth! The soft
lull of somnolency came at length to
my relief; and I began to nod my
assent, much to my tormentor's gratification.
But presently I was dead
asleep; and, most unfortunately, my
head dropped forward into the pit of
his stomach. The breath, knocked
out of his body, escaped with a gasp,
like an Indian's "ugh!" In a moment
I was broad awake, and made a thousand
apologies, which he politely accepted,
and renewed the thread of his
discourse. Again, I dropped off; and
again my head dropped forward.
Another "ugh!" another ocean of
apologies, another resumption of the
endless yarn. The other passengers,
two sedate and remarkably silent
gentlemen of Falmouth, in broad-brimmed
hats and drab coats of a
peculiar cut, had each his weather-eye
open, and began to enjoy the joke
amazingly. Gradually, once more,
the incessant clack subsided in my
ears to a pleasing hum; I was off;
the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar
muscles once more lost their tension
beneath the narcotic influence of
incessant sound; and my drowsy
head gave a pitch as before, with the
same results&mdash;"ugh!"&mdash;apologies unlimited&mdash;ditto
accepted&mdash;and more
yarn. The Quakers&mdash;I beg their
pardon, the "Friends"&mdash;are, you
must know, eminently humourists.
This, please to take notice, arises from
their superior intelligence, and high
degree of mental culture; the result
of which is high susceptibility. You
might now have seen, in our two fellow-travellers
in the Falmouth coach,
what you would see nowhere but in
their "connexion"&mdash;two men ready to
die of laughing, and each looking as
grave as a judge. For a few miles it
went on. Talk&mdash;sleep&mdash;head pitched
into bread-basket&mdash;"ugh!"&mdash;pungent
and profound regrets&mdash;regrets accepted&mdash;talk
recommenced&mdash;and so on
with a perpetual <i>da capo</i>. At length
the most gifted of gratuitous lecturers
began to perceive that he was
contributing to the amusement of the
party in a way that he had not intended,
and grew indignant. But I pacified
him, as we drove into Falmouth,
by politely soliciting a card of his
house; stepped out of the coach into
the coffee-room of the hotel, out of
the coffee-room into bed as soon as it
was ready, and made up for two
sleepless nights by not coming down to
breakfast till two o'clock the next day.</p>

<p>The Lisbon packet was not to sail
for a week. My extra baggage
arrived in due time by the heavy;
and I occupied the interval, as best I
could, in a pedestrian survey of the
environs of Falmouth, walks to Truro,
Pendennis Castle, &amp;c. I was much
delighted with clouted cream, and
gave the landlady an unlimited order
always to let me have a john dory for
dinner, when there was one in the
market. N.B.&mdash;No place like Falmouth
for john dories. Clouted cream
always ask for, when you go into the
West&mdash;very good with tea, not bad
with coffee; and <i>mem.</i>, unimpeachable
with apple-pie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span></p>

<p>The packet, that was to have the
honour of conveying me from Falmouth
to Lisbon, was a little tub of a gun-brig,
yclept the Princess Wilhelmina.
Judging from her entire want of all
the qualities requisite for the service
on which she was employed, I presume
she must have obtained the
situation through some member of
parliament. Her captain was laid up
with the gout; and we were to be
commanded by the mate, who turned
out to be a Yankee, and an ugly customer;
but more of him anon. At
the same hotel where I had established
my <i>habitat</i>, was a military party,
three in number, waiting, like myself,
for the sailing of the packet; yet not,
like myself, men fresh in the service,
but all three regular "Peninsulars"&mdash;men
who had returned on leave from
the British army, and were now about
to join, in time for the opening of the
campaign. They had established
themselves in a front drawing-room
on the first floor, seemed very fond of
music, and had good voices. But as
they always sang together, and each
sang his own song, it was not easy to
determine the vocal powers of each.
The coffee-room was quite good enough
for me; and there I had the honour
of forming the acquaintance of another
fellow-voyager that was to be&mdash;a
partner in a large London house in
the Manchester line, whom, to avoid
personality, I beg leave to distinguish
by the name of Gingham. He had
many of the peculiarities of Cockneyism,
and some that were entirely his
own; but I found him a very pleasant
companion, and we perambulated the
town and neighbourhood in company.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>My first chapter brought me, on my
way to Portugal, as far as the Royal
Hotel, Falmouth. At this stage of
my travels, I must beg to detain the
reader for a short space; for here it is
that I may be said to have had my
seasoning; here, in fact, I obtained
my first introduction to military society,
and to military life, as it prevailed
at the British headquarters in
the Peninsula. This advantage I
gained by falling in with the party of
"Peninsulars" already mentioned,
who were on their way out, like myself.
I must also make my readers
better acquainted with my friend
Gingham, whom I hope they will not
dislike on further knowledge. Gingham
and I afterwards campaigned in
company. I must premise that he
had a touch of romance; and, as I
afterwards discovered, had not been
brought up as a merchant.</p>

<p>It was the early spring of 1813: a
year big with events of import to
Spain, to France, to England, and, in
fact, to the whole of Europe. On
leaving London by the fast coach, we
had bowled away over frozen roads.
But at Falmouth, the trees were budding
in the hedgerows, the sun was
shining, the birds were singing; while
the soft air stole gently by, and,
whispering, sportively saluted us as it
passed, like some coy nymph invisible&mdash;that
idea was Gingham's&mdash;the sky
was clear, and the haze danced in the
sunshine on the distant hills&mdash;Gingham
again. Towards the afternoon, it
generally fell calm. The capacious
harbour, smooth as glass, though
gently undulating at its entrance, with
the swell of the Atlantic that rolled
lazily in, bore on its bosom not only
the tub-like Princess Wilhelmina and
her Yankee mate, but many a noble
vessel of ampler tonnage, that showed
no water-line in the transparent and
silent mirror on which it floated, and
seemed to hang suspended between
earth and heaven, motionless in the
sun-lit and misty ether.</p>

<p>A very odd fish was that Gingham.
We enjoyed our walks amazingly.
He was going out to Lisbon in a large
way, on a mission of mercantile speculation,
with full authority from his
firm to do anything and everything,
whether in the way of contracts for
the army, buying up commissariat
bills, engaging in monetary transactions,
or, above all&mdash;for that was his
chief object&mdash;forming a Peninsular connexion,
and opening a new market for
British goods. His was, indeed, a
voyage of enterprise and of discovery;
not, however, his first. His manners
were precise. He was a higgler in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
little things, but had large ideas, and
lots of gentlemanly feeling. Like
many other Cockneys of those days,
he was always dressed, and always
conscious of being dressed. His hat
was white, with the exception of the
interior green of the brim, which
matched with his spectacles. His
gloves were white, his unmentionables
were white, and so was his waistcoat.
His white cravat was tied before in a
sort of pilot-balloon, or white rosicrucian
puff. His hair also was
pomatum'd, and powdered white.
His very pigtail, all but the narrow
silk ribbon that held it together, was
white. His coat was not white, but
a light pepper-and-salt, approaching
to white. On the whole, there was
so much white in his general appearance,
that on board the packet he at
once received the name of "the white
man." He was generally well-informed,
but particularly so in matters
of commerce. Our intimacy increased
rapidly, and I afterwards, indeed very
soon, found the advantage of it. He
was naturally of a communicative disposition,
while he had much to communicate
that was worth knowing.
In me he found a willing hearer; for
I was glad to receive any kind of useful
information. With the prospect
before us of a campaign in common,
we soon knocked up a sort of friendship.</p>

<p>Gingham could do the handsome
thing. Two days before our embarkation
he insisted on my dining with
him&mdash;taking my chop with him, he
called it&mdash;in return for half a beefsteak,
which he had accepted from
me at breakfast, his own being delayed.
I entered the coffee-room at
the appointed hour; but was ushered
up stairs into a private room with
some degree of ceremony by the
waiter, who, I observed, had on
gloves, knees, silk stockings, and
pumps.</p>

<p>Gingham was there. He had ordered
a regular spread. We sat down.
The landlord, who had not hitherto
made himself visible, emerged on this
festive occasion, brought in the soup,
bowed, and retired. Gingham said
grace. The soup excellent: it was
turtle! "Capital turtle!" said I;
"had no idea that anything half so
good was to be had in all Falmouth."
"Always take a small stock when I
travel," said Gingham; "got a dozen
three-quart cases from Cornhill. Just
found room for it in my travelling
store-closet." "Travelling store-closet!"
thought I: "what a capital
fellow to campaign with!"</p>

<p>Soup removed. Re-enter landlord,
attended by waiter. John dory, in
compliment to me, splendid. Large
soles, fried. "I despise the man
that boils a sole," said Gingham. It
was despicable, I admitted. "My
dear sir," said he, "allow me to lay
down a principle, which you will find
useful as long as you live. With
<i>boiled</i> fish&mdash;turbot, for instance, or
john dory&mdash;always take sauce. You
did quite right, in allowing me to
help you to sauce just now. But with
<i>fried</i> fish, at least with fried sole&mdash;this,
for instance&mdash;never, never permit
sauce or melted butter to be put
upon your plate." It was a man&oelig;uvre
to get me to try the sole, after the
john dory. "Fried sole without
butter?" said I. "Try it my way,"
said Gingham, helping me: "take
some salt&mdash;that's right&mdash;now put to
that a modicum of cayenne&mdash;there&mdash;a
little more&mdash;don't be afraid of putting
enough&mdash;cayenne, though hot, is not
heating, like common pepper&mdash;now
mix them well together with the point
of your knife." I obeyed implicitly.
"Now then," said Gingham, with a
look of exultation, "<span class="smcap">TRY THAT</span>." I
tried it; and owned that I had never
known, till then, the right way of
eating fried sole. It was excellent,
even after the john dory. Try it, only
try it, the first time a fried sole appears
on the dinner table, under which
are your legs.</p>

<p>A peculiar sound at the side-table
now announced that he of the pumps
was opening a bottle of champagne.
Up to that moment we had managed
to put up with Madeira, which was
the fashionable dinner wine in those
days. N.B.&mdash;Good wine to be got at
Falmouth. It comes direct from
abroad, not vi&acirc; <i>London</i>.</p>

<p>Fish removed. Door opens. Though
rejoicing in those days in a very fair
appetite, I was rather alarmed, after
such a commencement of our humble
meal, at the thought of what might be
coming. But Gingham had a delicacy
of taste, which never overdid things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</a></span>
Enter once more the landlord, bearing
an elegant little saddle of Dartmoor
mutton, and audibly whispering to the
waiter, "Boiled fowls and tongue to
follow." I commenced this history
with a resolution to conceal nothing;
therefore, away with reserve: both
mutton, fowls, and tongue were excellent.
"A little more Madeira, Mr
Y&mdash;," said Gingham. The currant
jelly had distasted my mouth. I
merely put the glass to my lips, and
set it down again. Gingham observed,
and at once discovered the reason.
"Take a mouthful of potato," said
Gingham, "the hottest you can find
in the dish." My taste was restored.
Table cleared again. I hoped the
next <i>entr&eacute;e</i> would be the cheese and
celery.</p>

<p>During the short armistice, Gingham,
who delighted to communicate
useful knowledge, resumed the subject
of the potato. Like all merchants
who pay frequent visits to the Peninsula&mdash;and
Gingham had been there
often&mdash;he was knowing in wines, and
in everything vinous. "Yes," said
he, "nothing like a mouthful of hot
potato to make you taste wine. There
are lots of things besides, but none
equal to that. The invention is my
own."</p>

<p>"Then," replied I, "I presume you
use it at Oporto and Xeres, when you
make purchases?"</p>

<p>"Why, not exactly that neither,"
said he. "The worst of it is, it makes
all wine relish alike, bad as well as
good. Now, in buying wine, you
want something to distinguish the
good wine from the bad. And for
this purpose&mdash;" The landlord and
waiter reappeared.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Mr Y&mdash;, there is no game,"
said Gingham. "Fine jack hare in
the larder this morning, but rather
late in the season. Wouldn't have it.
Can you finish off with one or two
light things in the French way?"</p>

<p>"My dear sir, my dear sir!"</p>

<p>The table was this time covered
with such a display of <i>p&acirc;tisserie</i>, macaroni,
and made dishes, as would have
formed of itself a very handsome
<i>petit souper</i> for half-a-dozen people.
Gingham wanted me to try everything,
and set me an example.</p>

<p>The whole concluded, and the cloth
about to be removed, "Mr Gingham,"
said I, "you said grace before
dinner, and I think <i>I</i> ought to say
grace now." The waiter drew up
reverently with his back to the sideboard,
adjusted his neckcloth, and
tightened with his right hand the glove
upon his left.</p>

<p>We sat sipping our wine, and nibbling
at a very handsome dessert. I
wanted to know more about distinguishing
good wine from bad.</p>

<p>"I have made large purchases of
wine on commission," said Gingham,
"for private friends; and that, you
know, is a delicate business, and
sometimes a thankless one. But I
never bought a bad lot yet; and if
they found fault with it, I wouldn't
let them have it&mdash;kept it myself, or
sold it for more in the market."</p>

<p>"You were just on the point," said
I, "of mentioning a method of distinguishing
good wine from bad."</p>

<p>"Well," replied he, "those fellows
there, on the other side of the Bay of
Biscay, have methods innumerable.
After all, taste, judgment, and experience
must decide. The Oporto
wine-merchants, who know what
they are about, use a sort of silver
saucer, with its centre bulging upwards.
In this saucer they make the
wine spin round. My plan is different."</p>

<p>"I should like to know it," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said he, "mix with
water&mdash;two-thirds water to one-third
wine. Then try it."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"If there is any bad taste in the
wine, the mixing brings it out. Did
you never notice in London, even if
the port or sherry seems passable
alone, when you water it the compound
is truly horrid, too nauseous to drink?"</p>

<p>"The fact is, though a moderate
man, I am not very fond of watering
wine."</p>

<p>"The fact is," continued Gingham,
"there is very little good wine to be
got in London, always excepting such
places, for instance, as the Chapter.
When you return, after having tasted
wine in the wine countries, you will
be of my opinion. Much that you get
is merely poor wine of the inferior
growths, coloured, flavoured, and
dressed up with bad brandy for the
London market. That sort comes
from abroad. And much that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span>
get is not wine at all, but a decoction;
a vile decoction, sir; not a drop of
wine in its composition. That sort is
the London particular." I felt that I
was receiving ideas.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," said Gingham, "my
cold-water test detects this. If what
you get for wine is a decoction, a
compound, and nothing but a compound,
no wine in it, then the water&mdash;about
two-thirds to one-third&mdash;detects
the filthy reality. Add a
lump or two of sugar, and you get as
beastly a dose of physic as was ever
made up in a doctor's shop."</p>

<p>"Just such a dose," I replied, "as
I remember getting, now you mention
it, as I came down here by the fast
coach, at an inn where I asked, by
way of a change, for a glass of cold
white-wine negus. The slice of lemon
was an improvement, having done
duty before in a glass of gin punch."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't wonder," said Gingham.
"And if what you buy for port
or sherry be not absolutely a decoction,
but only inferior wine made up,
then the water equally acts as a detective.
For the dilution has the
effect of separating, so to speak, the
respective tastes of the component
parts&mdash;brings them out, sir; and you
get each distinct. You get, on the
one hand, the taste of the bad brandy,
harsh, raw, and empyreumatic: and
you get, on the other hand, the taste
of the poor, paltry wine, wretched
stuff, the true <i>vinho ordinario</i> flavour,
that makes you think at once of some
dirty roadside Portuguese <i>posada</i>,
swarming with fleas."</p>

<p>"But what if you water really good
wine?"</p>

<p>"Why, then," said Gingham, "the
flavour, though diluted, is still the
flavour of good wine."</p>

<p>"I should like," said I, "to be
knowing in wines."</p>

<p>Seeing in me a willing learner, he
was about to open. But at this moment
the mail drove into the yard of
the hotel; and, knowing that Gingham
was always ravenous for the
London journals on their first arrival,
I insisted on our going down into the
public room, taking a cup of coffee,
and reading the papers. We had
talked about wines; but, being neither
of us topers, had taken only a moderate
<i>quantum suff.</i>, though all of the
best kind. Gingham, out of compliment
to me, wished to prolong the
sitting. But, knowing his penchant
for a wet newspaper, I was inflexible.
We rose from the table.</p>

<p>I felt that I had been handsomely
entertained, and that something handsome
ought to be said. The pleasing
consciousness, however, of having
eaten a good dinner, though it excited
my finest feelings, did not confer the
faculty of expressing them. I began:</p>

<p>"Sir, Mr Gingham; I feel we
ought not to leave this room, till I
have expressed the emotions&mdash;" Then,
taking a new departure, "Really, sir,
your kind hospitality to a comparative
stranger&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Gingham, laughing,
"I will tell you how it was. Do
you remember your first breakfast in
the coffee-room, the day after your
arrival by the mail? I was present,
and enjoyed it amazingly."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir! oh, sir!" said I, a <i>leetle</i>
taken aback; "really I was enormously
hungry. In fact I had eaten
nothing during my two days' previous
journey; and was so sleepy on my
arrival, that I got to bed as fast as I
could, without thinking of ordering
supper. And when I came down
next morning, or rather afternoon,
why, to tell you the truth, I made it
breakfast and dinner in one; and
perhaps I did seem a little savage in
my first onset on the Falmouth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, <span class="smcap">NO</span>, NO!" exclaimed Gingham,
interrupting me. "That was
not it. No, <span class="smcap">NO</span>, NO! far from it.
My dear sir, you merely disposed of
two or three plates of ham and eggs;
then a few muffins, with about half-a-dozen
basins of tea. After that&mdash;let
me see&mdash;after that, to the best of
my recollection&mdash;after that, you took
nothing, no, nothing, but the mutton
chops. No, sir, it was not the quantity.
I have often made as hearty a
meal myself; and, if we campaign
together, I trust we shall often make
as hearty a meal together. Nothing
like campaigning for an appetite. No,
sir; that was not it. It was your
manner of taking it."</p>

<p>"My manner of taking it? Really!
And pray what did you see in my
manner of taking it?"</p>

<p>"Sir," said Gingham, with emotion,
"I know this house. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>
long used this house. Everything in
this house is good. The accommodation
is good. The attendance is
good. The wine is good. The dinners
are good. The breakfasts are
good. Now, sir, I have seen some
persons conduct themselves in this
house in a manner that filled me
with scorn, disgust, and indignation.
They arrive by the London mail, sir,
as you did, and go to bed. In the
morning they come down into the
public room, and order breakfast.
They breakfast, not like you, my dear
sir, very moderately, but enormously.
That I could forgive; after a long
journey it is excusable. But, sir,
what I cannot tolerate is this: They
find fault with everything. The tea
is bad; the coffee is bad. They take
up the silver cream-jug; examine the
clouted cream; smell to it&mdash;yes, sir;
they actually smell to it&mdash;and smelling
to anything, I need not say, is as
great a <i>b&ecirc;tise</i> as a man can commit at
table&mdash;ask the waiter what he means
by bringing them such stuff as that;
and, before they have done, gobble
up the whole, and perhaps call for
more."</p>

<p>"Call for more? Why, that, I
think, is exactly what I did."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear sir," said Gingham,
"you enjoyed it; and you
took a pretty good lot of it; but you
did not find fault with it. Not so the
people I am talking of. The fact is,
sir, we Londoners have a great idea
of keeping up our dignity. These
persons wish to pass for people of
importance; and they think importance
is announced by finding fault.
Item, they are enormously, indecently
hungry, and fully intend to make
a breakfast for two, but wish to do it
surreptitiously. On the arrival of
the beefsteak, they turn round the
dish, and look at it contemptuously,
longing, all the while, to fall to.
Yes, sir, they turn round the dish
two or three times; then stick their
fork into the steak, and turn it over
and over; perhaps hold it up, suspended
by a single prong, and examine
it critically; and end all by
pushing away their plate, drawing
the dish into its place, and bolting
the whole beefsteak, without taking
time to masticate. Sir, there was a
man in that coffee-room this morning,
who grumbled at everything, and ate
like a dog. In short, they clear the
table of eatables and drinkables; then
call the waiter, and reproach him,
with a savage look, for bringing them
a tough beefsteak; and, in a plaintive
voice, like ill-used men, inquire if
there is any cold meat-pie."</p>

<p>I owned, from personal observation
in the public room, to the general
correctness of this sketch.</p>

<p>"Now you, sir," continued Gingham,
"enjoyed your breakfast, and
made a good one; but found fault
with nothing; because, I presume,
there was nothing to find fault with.
I like to see a man enjoy his meals.
And if he does, I like to see him
show it. It is one of the tokens by
which I judge of character. Your
conduct, my dear sir, commanded my
respect. Shall I say more? It won
my esteem. Then and there my resolution
was formed, to invite you, at
the first convenient opportunity, to
partake of my humble hospitality."</p>

<p>It was too much. I extended my
fist. A shaking of hands, of some
continuance&mdash;cordial on my part, and
evidently so on Gingham's, by the
pain I felt in my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said Gingham, "I had
already learned that you were a passenger
for the Peninsula. I was a
passenger for the Peninsula; and, as
we were to sail together, and probably
to campaign together, I resolved
to introduce myself. I said,
this lad&mdash;I beg your pardon, this
youth&mdash;excuse me, this gentleman,
this young gentleman&mdash;for I guess
you have some ten years the advantage
of me in that respect&mdash;this
gentleman is, like myself, bound for
the headquarters of the Peninsular
army. I know something of campaigning;
he knows nothing. We
campaign together."</p>

<p>"Well now," said I, "that is just
what I should like amazingly."</p>

<p>Gingham now took the initiative,
and put forth his paw. Again we
tackled, and, in the true pump-handle
style, so dear to Englishmen, expressed
mutual cordiality: only that
this time, being better prepared, I
reversed the electric stream, and
brought tears into Gingham's eyes.
He sung out, "Oh!" and rubbed his
arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span></p>

<p>"The rest," said Gingham, "is
easily told. After breakfast you
walked out into the court-yard, lit a
cigar, and stood on the steps. I lit
another, followed, and had the pleasure
of making your acquaintance."</p>

<p>I gave audible expression to my
profound self-congratulations.</p>

<p>"Allow me, however, to add," said
Gingham, "you raised yourself greatly
in my esteem by asking the waiter
for a red herring. The request
evinced a superiority to vulgar prejudices.
Your way of putting it, too,
was in perfect good keeping: for you
did not commit yourself by <i>ordering</i>
a red herring; but asked whether
you could have one in the coffee-room.
Believe me, I was pained,
when he stated that red herrings
were not permitted; and could but
admire your self-denial, in accepting,
as a substitute, the mutton-chops."</p>

<p>We adjourned to the public room.</p>

<p>Gingham had entertained me hospitably
and handsomely. Yet this was
the same Gingham who, when I made
him take part of my beefsteak at
breakfast, because his own was delayed,
proposed that we should desire
the waiter to tell the landlady to
charge only half a beefsteak to me,
and half a beefsteak to him, Gingham.
My rejection of this proposal
was the immediate occasion of the
dinner, at which the reader has just
been present.</p>

<p>While we were eviscerating the
papers, fresh from London, Gingham
leaned over the table, with the air of
a man who had something important
to communicate. He looked me earnestly
in the face.</p>

<p>"Mr Y&mdash;&mdash;," said he, "what do you
say&mdash;to a red herring&mdash;this evening&mdash;for
supper?"</p>

<p>"Thank you. You must excuse
me. Nothing more to-night, but one
cup of coffee, and perhaps a cigar.
Not even an anchovy toast. I really
couldn't."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Gingham, "to-morrow
at breakfast. We will engage
a room up stairs, and ask leave
of nobody. I have brought down a
small barrel from London&mdash;always
take some when I visit the Peninsula&mdash;get
them in Lower Thames
Street. You will pronounce them
excellent."</p>

<p>The offer was too good to be declined.</p>

<p>Next morning we ordered breakfast
up stairs. Indeed, a fire had
been lit in one of the parlours, by
Gingham's directions; and there I
found him, with the table laid, and
the herrings ready for cooking. Gingham
had secured a small Dutch oven;
not with the design of <i>baking</i> the
herrings&mdash;no, no, he knew better
than that&mdash;but to keep them hot
when done. The doing he reserved
to himself, on the plea of experience.
I was not to assist, except in eating
them.</p>

<p>"Do you understand cookery, Mr
Y&mdash;?" said Gingham.</p>

<p>I ingenuously owned my deficiency
in that branch of education, which is
no part of the Cambridge curriculum.</p>

<p>"Three months at headquarters,"
said he, "will make you an excellent
cook."</p>

<p>It so happened that the parlour, in
which we had located ourselves for
the purpose of cooking our herrings,
was not that in which we had dined
the day before, but one adjoining the
larger apartment occupied by the
three military gentlemen, with whom
we were to cross the Bay of Biscay.
A boarding, removable at pleasure,
was the only separation between the
two rooms. We had not yet become
acquainted.</p>

<p>Shortly after I joined Gingham,
two of the three entered their parlour;
presently the third followed. They
rang the bell, and ordered breakfast,
all in high good humour, and talking
incessantly. We were not listeners,
but could not help hearing every word
that was said.</p>

<p>"Good blow-out that, yesterday."&mdash;"Pity
we didn't know of it sooner;
might as well have dined with them."&mdash;"Turtle,
too."&mdash;"'Pon your honour?"&mdash;"Turtle,
and lots of champagne.
Caught the waiter swigging off
the end of a bottle in the passage."&mdash;"Who
are they?"&mdash;"Don't know;
can't make them out. Both going
out with us in the packet, though."&mdash;"Think
I remember seeing the white
fellow at Cadiz; almost sure I did;
and afterwards again at Madrid. Always
wore his hair in that way, well
floured and larded, except when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
was too hot, and combed down
straight on each side of his ugly face."&mdash;"What
a nose! Prodigious! A
regular proboscis."&mdash;"Yes, and all on
one side, like the rudder of a barge."&mdash;"Let
me tell you, a very good thing;
for if it was straight, it would be
always in his way."&mdash;"Always in his
way? Why it would trip him up
when he walked."&mdash;<i>Omnes</i>, "Ha, ha,
ha."&mdash;"Going with us, do you say?
Hope he don't snore. Why, such a
<i>tromba</i> as that would keep a whole
line-of-battle ship awake."&mdash;"Bet
you a dollar he's blind of one eye."&mdash;"Done."
"Done. Book it, major."&mdash;"I'll
trouble you for a dollar. He
does walk a little sideways, but it isn't
his eye."&mdash;"What is it, then? One-eyed
people always walk sideways."&mdash;"Why,
I'll tell you, now. It's a
principle which most people observe
through life."&mdash;"What principle?"&mdash;"Guess."&mdash;"Come,
tell us, old fellow.
None of your nonsense."&mdash;"D'ye
give it up?"&mdash;"Yes, I give it
up. Come, tell us."&mdash;"Follow your
nose."&mdash;<i>Omnes</i>, "Ha, ha, ha."&mdash;"Capital!
capital! That's the best
we've had for some time. Follow
your nose! Capital! Ha, ha, ha."&mdash;"Well,
that's it, depend upon it.
Other people follow their noses by
walking straight forward. That white
fellow walks sideways, but still follows
his nose."&mdash;"No, no, major. Your
theory is fallacious. When he walks
his nose points backwards. His nose
points over his left shoulder, and he
walks right shoulders forward." I
looked at Gingham, and laughed.
Gingham was looking rather grave,
and feeling his nose. "No, no. I
tell you he walks <i>left</i> shoulders forward."&mdash;"Bet
you a dollar."&mdash;"Done."&mdash;"Done.
Book it, major."&mdash;"I'll
trouble you for a dollar. Saw
him this morning, all in a bustle.
Took particular notice of his nose."&mdash;"Who
is the young chap?"&mdash;"Oh,
he's a regular Johnny Newcome, that's
evident."&mdash;"Johnny Newcome? Yes;
but I wish he wasn't such a chap for
john dories. Price in the market is
doubled." Gingham laughed and
looked at me. "Suppose he's a sub
going out to join his regiment."&mdash;"No,
no. Got such lots of baggage.
No regimental officer would be ass
enough to take such a heap of trunks.
Load for three mules."&mdash;"He'll soon
knock up. Those long fellows always
knock up."&mdash;"Shouldn't wonder if he
gets the fever next autumn. Then
what will his mammy say?"&mdash;"Well,
but what did they dine about? Thousand
pities we did not join them."&mdash;"Oh,
I suppose it was something of
a parting feed; taking leave of Old
England, you know: toasting Miss
Ann Chovy, Miss Mary Gold, Miss
Polly Anthus, and all that kind of
thing."&mdash;"Hang it all; a good dinner
for eight people; thousand pities we
missed it."</p>

<p>By this time, our cookery was proceeding
in due course. Two splendid
bloaters, whole, lay extended where
chestnuts are roasted; while two more,
split open, hung suspended from a large
toasting-fork, held by Gingham, who
told me to look and learn, but not to
meddle. With a clear bright fire, they
soon began to spit. Nor was there
wanting another token of our operations.
For now the savoury odour of
four red herrings, simultaneously under
a brisk process of culinary preparation,
diffused itself through the
apartment, and no doubt through the
whole hotel, from the cellar to the
attics. The effect on our friends in
the next room was instantaneous.
Conversation ceased. Then there was
a deal of sniffing&mdash;then audible whispering
and suppressed laughter&mdash;then
again, a dead silence. Gingham and
I exchanged looks. "We <i>must</i> be
acquainted," said Gingham, quietly;
"and the sooner the better." I saw
he had made up his mind, and was
prepared for what was about to take
place. Then the conversation was
heard a little louder, but not distinguishable.
There was evidently a
council of war. Much laughter. Then,
audibly spoken, "Are you fond of
herrings?"&mdash;"Very; capital for
breakfast."&mdash;"So am I, very; that is,
of <i>red</i> herrings. <i>Fresh</i>, can't endure
them."&mdash;"Nor I; they have such a
horrid <span class="smcap">SMELL</span>. But a bloater,&mdash;often
dined off them up the country; didn't
we, major?"&mdash;"Oh yes, lots of times.
But you were moderate. Never could
manage above half-a-dozen at a sitting."&mdash;"Ring
for the waiter."&mdash;"No,
no; nonsense. Major M&mdash;, <span class="smcap">YOU</span>."
After a moment's pause, one of the
party left the room; walked, appa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>rently
to the end of the passage; then
walked back again; opened our door;
entered, and politely apologised for
the mistake. He was a middle-aged,
well-built, gentlemanly-looking man,
with <i>bonhomie</i> beaming in his countenance,
and came at once to business.
His eye dropped upon the herrings.</p>

<p>"Beg ten thousand pardons. Oh!
I see it's <i>here</i>. We perceived that
bloaters were frying somewhere in the
house, and thought we should like to
try a few. Will you have the kindness
to inform me where they can be
procured? Didn't know there was a
single bloater in all Falmouth."</p>

<p>I, in my simplicity, thought the
major was really asking for <i>information</i>,
and was going to tell him of
several shops where I had seen
bloaters; but Gingham was too
quick for me.</p>

<p>"Here is a barrel-full," said Gingham,
pointing to the corner of the
room. "Shall be most happy to supply
you and your friends with any
quantity. Do me the favour to accept
of two or three dozen."</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir," said Major M&mdash;,
drawing up, as if he had been misunderstood.
The major was playing a
higher game. "Couldn't think of
such a thing. Thought you had procured
them in the town."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir," said Gingham, "I
don't think the town contains their
equals. They are from London direct.
Always take a small barrel with me
when I visit the Peninsula. Get
them in Lower Thames Street."</p>

<p>"Really, a most excellent idea,"
said Major M&mdash;. "I wish I had
done the same. Well, I think I never
will return to headquarters again
without taking a barrel of red herrings."
The Major cast a sort of
domesticated look about the room,
as if he felt quite at home with
us.</p>

<p>"Go it, Major!" said an opening in
the partition, <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p>"Come, Major," said Gingham, "I
see you and the gentlemen your companions
are old campaigners. So am
I. Suppose we waive ceremony. You
see we have got our cooking apparatus
all ready. Suppose&mdash;do us the favour&mdash;excuse
the shortness of the invitation&mdash;I
shall be delighted, and so will
my friend here, if you and your party
will oblige us with your company to
breakfast."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Major," said the crevice,
as before. "Yes, Major, yes," said
another crevice.</p>

<p>"Really, sir," said the Major, with
an admirably assumed look of polite
embarrassment, and turning a deaf
ear to his two prompters behind the
scenes&mdash;"really, sir, I hardly know
how to thank you sufficiently for your
obliging invitation. But&mdash;shall we
not intrude? You meant to breakfast
in private. You have, perhaps,
business? Matters to arrange, preparatory
to the voyage?"</p>

<p>"None in the world, sir," said Gingham,
"till after breakfast. Our only
business here is to cook our bloaters
and eat them, which we could not do
in the public room below. Do, pray,
oblige us by negotiating this little
affair, Major, and persuade your
friends to favour us with their company."</p>

<p>The Major, in fact, was negotiating
already; and a capital negotiator he
made. He might, had he pleased,
have walked off, at an earlier stage of
the proceedings, with a whole pile of
herrings; and even that, at college,
we should have thought a capital <i>coup</i>.
But the Major was not so green.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, since you are so very
pressing, I shall have the pleasure of
communicating to my comrades your
kind invitation; and I presume," he
added, bowing politely to me, "I may
also have the honour of saying,
the invitation of your friend, Captain
Y&mdash;."</p>

<p>I bowed in return, too much taken
by surprise to disclaim the rank so
unexpectedly conferred; and a little
sore at being saluted "captain," by
the same voice which I had heard,
just before, proclaiming aloud, that if
I was a regimental officer I was an
ass. The Major bowed again; backed
out of the room, still bowing, and
closed the door.</p>

<p>The remaining negotiation was not
of long continuance. His two friends
were already in the passage, hard by
the entrance of our apartment. A
dead silence&mdash;one irrepressible burst
of laughter, instantly hushed&mdash;again
dead silence&mdash;a tap at the door&mdash;door
opened by Gingham&mdash;and enter <span class="smcap">the
three Peninsulars</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span></p>

<p>I really could not help admiring the
perfectly free and easy, but at the
same time quiet, self-possessed, and
gentlemanly style of their <i>entr&eacute;e</i>, and
of their bearing during the first few
moments of our interview. Gingham
expressed his gratification; was happy
to see them. Advancing on their
right flank, taking up a central position,
and then facing to the left,
"Allow me," said the major, "to
avail myself of my brief priority of
acquaintance, and to introduce&mdash;Captain
Gabion, of the Royal Engineers,"
(bowing, on both sides)&mdash;"and Mr
Commissary Capsicum," (more bowing,)&mdash;"half-brothers,
I need not say&mdash;the
family likeness is so striking."
Gingham presented Mr Y&mdash;. Mr
Y&mdash;(booby!) presented Gingham.</p>

<p>"Not very striking that family
likeness, though," thought I, of course
taking seriously what the wag of a
major spoke with perfect seriousness.
The captain of the Engineers was a
pale-looking man, buttoned up to the
chin in his regulation frock-coat, rather
above the common height, air military
and symmetrical. Education had
traced on his countenance the lines of
thought; and, in short, his whole appearance
was a little aristocratic, and
what we now call <i>distingu&eacute;</i>. His
"half-brother," the commissary, on
the contrary, who appeared at least
twelve years his senior, was a short,
pursy, puffy man; with a full, rubicund,
oleaginous, and pimpled visage;
a large, spongy, purple blob of a
nose, its broad lower extremity pendulous,
and slightly oscillatory when
he moved; a humorous twinkle in his
eye, which was constantly on the
range in search of fun; two black,
bushy tufts for eyebrows; his hair distributed
over his ample pericranium
in large detached <i>flocks</i>, each flock
growing a way of its own, and no two
alike; coat flying open; waistcoat
open, all but the two bottom buttons;
a bull neck, with very little cravat;
and a profuse display of shirt and
frill. His shirt and frill, imperfectly
closed, revealed his grizzly chest;
while his nether extremities were set
off to great advantage by a pair of
tight blue kerseymere pantaloons with
a scarlet stripe; and something&mdash;I
suppose, as bustles were not then the
fashion, it must have been his tailors'
clumsiness&mdash;imparted a peculiar
breadth and bulge to the tail of his
coat. He wore splendid gaiters of
bright nankeen, with mother-of-pearl
buttons. No ceremony when gentlemen
meet. We were all quite at
home in a moment.</p>

<p>There was a little hitch. All the
party were quite of one mind and
will, in the project and purpose of
cooking and eating bloaters. But
how were five cooks to cook at one
fire?</p>

<p>We all saw it together. I looked
at the partition. "Better unship
that," said the commissary. The
commissary, I soon saw, was, by
common consent, the commanding
officer of the party. We went to
work; and in no time the partition
was cleverly removed, and stowed
away on one side. We thus made
our small parlour a large one, with
the additional advantage of two fires
instead of one for our culinary operations.
Gingham, meanwhile, had
slipped out of the room; but returned
in a few minutes, looking quite innocent.
He had been absent to some
purpose, as the result shortly proved.
We now found full employment with
the herrings, roasting and toasting.
Gingham, the captain, and the major,
at the larger fire; I and Mr Commissary
Capsicum at the other.</p>

<p>Gingham, when he left the room,
had given his order; a <i>carte blanche</i>
to the whole establishment to extemporise
as handsome a breakfast as
circumstances would permit, with a
special caveat against delay.</p>

<p>Enter the waiter, with a tray, and
a large tablecloth.&mdash;Previous set-out
transferred from the table to the tray,
and placed on the sideboard.&mdash;Two
tables run into one&mdash;fresh tablecloth
laid.&mdash;Exit waiter.</p>

<p>Enter waiter again, with plates,
cups and saucers, knives, forks, and
spoons, basin, two sugar-basins&mdash;in
short, all the apparatus of a breakfast-table.&mdash;The
whole laid, in the
twinkling of an eye.&mdash;Exit waiter.</p>

<p>Enter waiter a third time, with a
large tray&mdash;bread, (varieties,) butter,
water-cresses, ham, tongue, cold fillet
of veal, cold chicken, cold pigeon-pie,
all the cold eatables.&mdash;Boots handed
in from the door a large block of
quince marmalade, on a silver salver.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>&mdash;Boots
handed in small jars: potted
shrimps, pickled oysters, pot of Scotch
honey, strawberry jam, other jams.&mdash;Boots
handed in one larger jar, a
Portuguese conserve, <i>quartos de marmelas</i>.
(N. B. quinces cut up into
lumps, and boiled in Brazilian sugar.
Portuguese beat all the world in
sweetmeats, and <i>quartos de marmelas</i>
beat all the rest.) I guessed Gingham
had given the landlady the key
of his travelling store-chest.&mdash;Boots
handed in milk, cream, clouted cream.
Boots handed in two splendid brass
kettles of boiling water, one of which
waiter placed on each fire.&mdash;Exit
waiter.</p>

<p>A temporary pause. During this
lull, the utmost energies of the house
were in exercise below, to provide
with despatch the remaining <i>mat&eacute;riel</i>
of our humble meal. I observed,
from time to time, that he of the commissariat
eyed the preparations with
peculiar benignity. It was all in his
way, as I subsequently had the
pleasure of experiencing, among the
sources of the Adour and the Garonne.
"Ever been with the army?" said he.&mdash;"Never,"
said I; "but hope to be
soon."&mdash;"Hope you'll often dine with
me. But don't spoil that fine bloater.
There, hold it a little further from the
fire. Red herring should be toasted,
not burnt to death. Done, when the
backbone is crisp; not before. But
should not be done quickly, like
murder in Shakspeare. Do it slowly,
my dear sir; do it slowly. If you do
it fast, you burn all the flavour out of
it." I saw he was a connoisseur.</p>

<p>Yet&mdash;stupid, conceited, arrogant
young coxcomb&mdash;so inexperienced
was I then, so indignant at the
shadow of interference, so unaccustomed
to anything that bore the least
semblance of control, I inwardly
curled at even these valuable and truly
philanthropic suggestions&mdash;thought it
all exceedingly odd, and took it for
dictation.</p>

<p>Lots of bloaters were now toasted
or roasted, and prepared for eating.
Just as we were ready, for the fourth
time enter waiter, bringing eggs,
coffee-pot, two tea-pots, (tea and
coffee ready,) muffins, hot buttered
rolls, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. But among the
<i>etceteras</i> I really must pause, to specify
a certain delicate sort of round
west-country breakfast cake&mdash;piles of
which were also brought in, buttered
and smoking hot. Gingham whispered
the waiter, "Keep on bringing <i>them</i>."</p>

<p>Gingham, with his usual judgment,
had prohibited anything hot in the
shape of chops, steaks, cutlets, grills,
rashers, or even kidneys. It was a
herring breakfast; and he excluded
what would only have divided the
appetite, and interfered with the
bloaters.</p>

<p>We made a capital breakfast.
Everything was excellent. The pile
of breakfast cakes received perpetual
accessions, but never gained in height.
The bloaters, however, were the staple
of our meal; and Gingham's barrel
suffered a considerable reduction. As
we were all sensible people, or wished
to appear so, there was very little
talk; and what there was referred to
the important business in hand. At
length it was clear that we had breakfasted.
Gingham was beginning to
recommend the knick-knackeries&mdash;jams,
pickled oysters, marmalade.
Each seemed disposed to pause, yet
none had quite left off. Our guests
were evidently telegraphing, and exchanging
looks of approval, when&mdash;</p>

<p>Enter the waiter once more, bringing,
upon a silver tray, two curiously
shaped bottles cased in a sort of
wicker-work, with glasses. A splendid
Italian liqueur! It was sipped,
approved, tossed off with wonderful
despatch. One by one we gradually
leaned back in our chairs, and the
bottles began to move round, as if
spontaneously. That is, I cannot
exactly say I saw any one pass them;
but from time to time, first here, first
there, I noticed a little finger pointing
to the ceiling; a movement which
certainly had something to do with
the progress of the bottles. We sat,
sipped, and chatted. Our breakfast
was an accomplished fact.</p>

<p>"Hear, hear, hear!" Mr Commissary
Capsicum was on his legs. Knuckles
rapped; glasses jingled; "Hear, hear,
hear!"&mdash;The telegraphic communications
of his two friends had intimated
to him their wishes: the unexpected
bonus of the liqueur, coming in at
the last, had awakened, in his own
bosom, its most benevolent emotions:
he rose to acknowledge our hospitality;
and in his friends' name, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
well as in his own, to invite us that
day to dinner.</p>

<p>His address I shall not attempt to
report. It was brief, well-bred, and
well-expressed; had several good
points, and was heard with immense
applause. He invited us to dinner;
gave Gingham's health and mine;
and concluded by observing that,
"conscious that he had not made a
neat and appropriate speech, he
begged leave," (filling, and suiting the
action to the word,) "to drink long
life and prosperity to us, in a neat
and appropriate bumper." Considering
it was our first meeting, I did
think <i>that</i> was a little broad.</p>

<p>Gingham returned thanks, and gave
the health of Major M&mdash;, R.A.
Major M&mdash; returned thanks.</p>

<p>I returned thanks, and gave the
health of Captain Gabion, R.E.</p>

<p>Captain Gabion returned thanks,
sat down, and rose a second time, but
was anticipated by
Gingham again, who gave the health
of Mr Commissary Capsicum.</p>

<p>Mr Commissary Capsicum returned
thanks.</p>

<p>With respect to the dinner, it would
not do. It was our last day before
sailing; Gingham had whole reams of
letters to write; I also had matters
to attend to; we pleaded the circumstances,
and begged to be excused.
Our friends saw the difficulty, and
reluctantly accepted our apologies.</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause. Then
all three rose from the table at once,
again thanked us politely for our hospitality,
and withdrew to their private
apartments. Shortly after, looking
out of the window, I saw them walking
down the street, all arm in arm,
and each puffing a cigar.</p>

<p>Gingham stood pensive by the fire,
his elbow on the mantelpiece, his head
leaning on his hand.</p>

<p>"I fear," said I, "your exertions
to entertain your guests have wearied
you."</p>

<p>He made no reply. I went up to him.
He seemed to awake as from a reverie.</p>

<p>"Hang it!" said Gingham, in a
plaintive tone, "there <i>should</i> have
been some mashed potatoes."</p>

<p>"Never mind, my dear sir&mdash;excellent
breakfast; everything went off
capitally. I, for one, enjoyed it
amazingly."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gingham, mournfully;
"but, to make the thing complete,
there <i>should</i> have been some mashed
potatoes with the bloaters. Had I
only known of it in time! By the
bye," added he, "I thought once or
twice, you did not seem entirely at
your ease. Nothing more gentlemanly,
my dear sir, than your general manner.
But at times, it struck me, you
did appear a little&mdash;a little&mdash;stiffish.
You must get rid of that before we
reach headquarters."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "I'll tell you.
That 'captain' stuck in my gizzard.
There's the truth. Coupled with what
we heard previously, and Major M&mdash;
must have known that we heard it, it
was just the same as calling me a
donkey to my face."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's nothing," said Gingham.
"Don't distress yourself about such
trifles as that."</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth," said I,
"the whole thing appeared to me
a little too free and easy. Here were
you and I preparing to take a quiet
breakfast, when those three guerilla
fellows, with their off-hand Peninsular
manners, actually took us by
storm, made a most ferocious attack
on your barrel of herrings, sunk it one-third,
drank up your two bottles of
liqueurs, and civilly wished us good
morning. Now, when I was at college,
to be sure we were merry enough,
no etiquette, no ceremony there. But
then there was a certain gentlemanly
feeling, which forbade vulgar familiarity
in any shape. And as to people
that assumed, or made free, I always
kept them at arm's length."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr Y&mdash;," said Gingham,
"I see plainly how it is. Follow my
advice. If you can't take a joke,
resign your appointment, forfeit your
money, and return to London. You'll
find it awkward enough living among
military men on actual service."</p>

<p>"I trust," said I, "by adhering to
my invariable rule, never to offer a
deliberate insult, but at the same time
never to brook one, go where I will, I
shall be fortunate enough to escape
disagreeable rencontres."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Gingham, looking
very serious, and speaking quite
in a sharp and peremptory tone&mdash;"nonsense!"
Then softening a little,
"Rencontres, my dear sir? Ren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>contres?
Nothing of the kind. Rencontres?
You talk like a militia
officer. Rencontres? You'll soon
dismiss all that kind of thing from
your thoughts, after you have seen
two or three rencontres with the
French. Rencontres? No, no; no
field of forty footsteps at headquarters.
Rencontres? It would be a perfect
absurdity, where men have the chance
of being shot gratis every day of their
lives, without going out of the way
for it. Rencontres? No; I did not
mean that. What I meant to say
was this: you would infallibly be
made a general butt. Rencontres?
Why, Mr Y&mdash;, if you show any
nonsense of that sort, you'll be tormented
to death. Rencontres? Oh,
what lots of fun they'll take out of
you! Meanwhile, think yourself fortunate
that you are now getting a
seasoning. I am truly glad, for your
sake, that you have had the opportunity
here at Falmouth, and will have
the opportunity on your passage out,
of seeing something of military men
and modes before you join. You
may, and probably will, be dubbed,
on your arrival, a Johnny Newcome.
But, at any rate, you will not be a
Johnny Raw."</p>

<p>Gingham closed the conference by
walking to the other end of the room,
and steadfastly contemplating his own
beautiful physiognomy in the glass.
During our conversation, his hand
had frequently visited his nose. He
now stood opposite the mirror, slewing
his head first this way, then that,
and at length broke silence:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I was not aware of it; but
I do think that my nose is a little
crooked."</p>

<p>"I presume," said I, "you have no
sisters?"</p>

<p>"I have none," replied Gingham.</p>

<p>"Nor are you, I apprehend, a married
man?"</p>

<p>"There, alas, you are right again,"
said Gingham; "but what has that
to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Your wife, or your sisters, if you
had any, would have told you that
you have a very crooked nose."</p>

<p>"Well, but," said Gingham,
"there's my mother. My dear
mother never told me that my nose
was crooked."</p>

<p>"Your mother, probably, is totally
unconscious of the fact; and, should she
hear any one else assert such a thing,
would deny it most strenuously."</p>

<p>"Nay, but," said Gingham, "though
I have neither sister nor wife, and
supposing my dear mother to be blind
to my personal defects, I have&mdash;in
short, Mr Y&mdash;, before I left London,
I took a tender leave of her
whom I hope to persuade, on my next
return from the Peninsula, to accept
the hand and the heart of a Gingham.
<span class="smcap">She</span> did not tell me that my nose was
crooked. She mentioned various obstacles
to our union; but she never
mentioned <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"Then," said I, "depend upon it,
she means to have you. And depend
upon this, too; she will tell you your
nose is crooked when you have made
her Mrs Gingham, if she does not tell
you so before."</p>

<p>"As to my walking sideways,"
said Gingham, "that's a palpable
fiction."</p>

<p>"Here," said I, "come to this extremity
of the room, and place yourself
opposite the glass." He came,
and placed himself accordingly.</p>

<p>"Now walk straight down upon,
the glass, keeping your eye fixed upon
your reflected nose."</p>

<p>"What nose? Which nose?" said
Gingham, in a state of obvious alarm.
"Do you mean the nose in my
face?"</p>

<p>"I mean your nose in the glass."
He walked as I had directed.</p>

<p>"Well, really," said Gingham,
it's extraordinary; it's very curious.
When I walk and look at my nose in
the glass, it appears quite straight
again&mdash;just as it ought to be, in the
middle of my face."</p>

<p>"That's just it," said I. "Then
you walk sideways. Depend upon it,
if you walked straight, your nose
would appear crooked."</p>

<p>He repeated the experiment again,
and again, muttering to himself,
"Very remarkable, very curious;
quite a natural phenomenon."</p>

<p>"Don't distress yourself about your
nose," said I; "it is a good enough
nose, in magnitude respectable, though
not strictly rectilinear. Make yourself
easy; and say, with Erasmus,
'Nihil me p&oelig;nitet hugeous nasi.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span></p>


<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>Where Gingham got his classical
knowledge, I had not at this time
ascertained. Certain it is, he was a
very fair classic. But there was one
dreadful drawback to his character,
and, in a man of his gravity, a strange
one: I mean his offensive, horrid
practice of making most atrocious
Latin puns. A pun in English he
viewed with utter contempt. It
stirred his bile. No English pun
escaped his lips. But for a Latin
pun, he scrupled not to lay under
contribution even the first-rate Latin
poets, Virgil, Ovid&mdash;nay, his favourite
author, Horace; and if I, influenced
by bad example, was weak
enough, in an unguarded moment, to
commit the same offence, he stole my
puns, and made them again as his
own.</p>

<p>On the eve of our embarkation we
strolled forth, after an early dinner,
for a parting view of the sunset from
the castle. Walking up town, we
met the man of rum, the sleep-murdering
Macbeth of the mail-coach. Still
he was talking&mdash;for want of company,
talking to himself. But his eyes were
set, half-closed, and dim; his aspect
was peculiarly meditative, and his
course curvilinear. He had taken on
board <i>plus &aelig;quo</i> of his own samples.
Perceiving our approach, he gave a
lurch to clear us. But his legs, being
not altogether under management,
brought him exactly in the direction
which he sought to shun; his stomach,
which had already suffered so
many assaults in the coach, most unfortunately
impinged upon my elbow;
and again it was "ugh!" His gummy
eyes expanded, and gleamed on us
like two fresh-opened oysters. Awhile
he gazed with drunken gravity; then,
turning round, bent over the roadside
gutter, as if about to tumble in, and
jocosely imitated the operation of
drawing a cork. His organs of vision
then assumed a slow movement of
horizontal oscillation, and gradually
settled on a pastry-cook's shop over
the way. Towards this point he directed
his zigzag approaches, recommencing
his agreeable conference with
himself, in terms of which we could
catch only the words&mdash;"Archimedes&mdash;screw&mdash;pneumatic
chemistry&mdash;soda
water&mdash;pop!" He left with us the
odour of a very bad cigar, which led
Gingham to remark that he was
"backy plenus" in more senses than
one.</p>

<p>The influence of bad example is
dreadful. Emerging from the town in
our way to the castle, we met a merry
party, male and female, all equestrians
save some six or eight, who occupied
the interior and exterior of a
post-chaise. Gingham, who saw into
a thing at once, pronounced them a
wedding party; and a buxom dame,
who was mounted on a lively little
west country galloway, the bride.
"Pony subit conjux," said I. "Yes,"
said Gingham; "but if that dear lady
rides so near the carriage, oh! oh!
oh! she will infallibly be capsized!
'Pony sub curru nimium propinqui!'"
We reached the hill in time, saw a
glorious sunset, and returned to letter-writing,
and a light supper on

<p>As Gingham appears more than
once upon the stage in the course of
my Peninsular adventures, and I
should really be sorry to annoy the
reader, as much as I was annoyed
myself, with his perpetual and abominable
perversions of classic latinity, I
beg leave to dispose of this part of the
subject at once, before we get to sea.
Suffice it to say, then, that in the
spring of the year 1838, just a quarter
of a century after the period of which
I am now writing, I once more left
London for Falmouth, <i>en route</i> to Lisbon,
though with an object far different
from that of my voyage now to
be recorded, and in a far different capacity.
Science, in these five-and-twenty
years, had done wonders; and
I had secured my passage in London,
not by a miserable tub of a sailing
packet, but by a well-found and fast
Peninsular steamer. The day before
the steamer was to start from Falmouth,
I walked down to the water's
side to take a view of her. On the
quay stood Gingham. By one of
those strange coincidences which sometimes
happen in life, we had again met
at Falmouth, and were again to cross
the Bay of Biscay in company. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
recognised him: he did not recognise
me. Time had somewhat changed
his look, his dress very little. Its
predominant aspect was still white.
His nose, too, was unmistakeable.
Perceiving at once that he was, like
myself, a passenger to the Peninsula,
I availed myself of the freedom conceded
in such cases, and commenced a
conversation by some remark on the
steamer.</p>

<p>"I presume, sir," said he, "you are
a passenger?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr Gingham, and so are
you. Glad to meet you." He stared,
but admitted the fact.</p>

<p>"But, sir," said he, "you have the
advantage of me."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said I, "you'll find
me out to-morrow on board the Guadalquivir.
Fine ship that. To-morrow,
you know, as Horace said, when
he was off by the steamer:-'Cras,
ingins! iterabimus &aelig;quor!"</p>

<p>The effect was instantaneous. Gingham
did not speak, he shouted:&mdash;"Dine
with me: I have got a john dory."</p>

<p>We walked off to the town&mdash;I rubbing
my shoulder, which Gingham
shook, when he shook my hand&mdash;he,
for a few paces, thoughtful and silent.
I expected a burst of sentiment.</p>

<p>"By the bye," said Gingham,
"while your hand was in, you might
just as well have quoted the <i>other</i> line,
for that, also, refers to our voyage."</p>

<p>"The other line?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the other line. Don't you
see that pair of rooks flying over the
harbour?"</p>

<p>"Rooks fly in droves. I see no
rooks."</p>

<p>"Right," said he; "they are a
couple of crows."</p>

<p>"But the line from Horace, referring
to our voyage?"</p>

<p>"Not only referring to it," said
Gingham, "but highly encouraging.
'Nil desperandum two crow duce, et
auspice two crow."</p>

<p>"Gingham, you are incorrigible."</p>

<p>To reach the street from the water's
side we had to pass through a narrow
passage, and there met the stewardess
of the steamer, who was going on
board. She stalked along in clogs on
tiptoe, her left hand gathering up, behind,
her cloak, gown, petticoat, &amp;c.,
while her right hand bore an umbrella
one size larger than a parasol, and a
reticule one size less than a pannier;
emerging from which pannier appeared
the ugly mug of an enormous Portuguese
red ram cat, the pet of the
stewardess, and the constant companion
of her Peninsular voyages.</p>

<p>"My cat inter omnes," said Gingham.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But I have rambled, and am a
quarter of a century wide of the mark.
The period of which I have now to
write, the important period to which
my present narrative refers, is not the
more recent year, 1838, but the remoter
year, 1813, glorious in the
annals of England; the year that saw
the commencement of Napoleon's
downfall; the year of triumph and
rout beneath the walls of Vittoria;
the year of a still sterner and equally
successful conflict at St Sebastian;
the year, too, that furnished a name
for a princess of a royal line, that
<span class="smcap">Queen Victoria</span> who, in her high
estate and royal clemency, remembered
and rewarded the long-forgotten
and long unrecompensed heroes of
those bygone times. In the early
spring of that year, 1813, I was there
at Falmouth, a raw youth, launched
on the wide world in search of adventure,
burning to reach the headquarters
of the Peninsular army, fully
capable of making a fool of myself
when I got there, and anxiously waiting
for the sailing of the Princess
Wilhelmina gun-brig, which, for want
of a better, performed the office of
Lisbon packet. It was well for me
that, at Falmouth, I had already fallen
into friendly hands.</p>

<p>On the morning of our embarkation,
March the&mdash;th, 1813, Gingham went
early on board the packet, for his personal
baggage was bulky and various,
to see to its stowage&mdash;part in his berth,
part in the hold. It was settled between
us that he was to return ashore,
that we were to breakfast together at
the hotel, and afterwards go off together
to the packet, which was still
lying in the harbour, and was to sail
about noon.</p>

<p>I waited breakfast for Gingham, but
no Gingham came. At length I received
a long note from him, dated on
board the packet. It began by stating
that an attempt had been made to
impose upon him, and that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
determined not to stand it. The attempted
imposition, as I learned from
him afterwards, was this:&mdash;</p>

<p>Gingham walked down from the
hotel to the water's side, and engaged
a boat, which was to take him on
board the packet for eighteen-pence;
he, Gingham, understanding thereby,
according to the tenor of many previous
bargains at the same rate of payment,
that he was to be taken on
board, and put on shore again. On
this, however, the last day of our
abode at Falmouth, the two boatmen,
thinking they might safely try it on,
and conjecturing also that Gingham's
time might possibly be too valuable to
be wasted in discussion, determined to
take a different view of the subject,
and exact a second fare for landing
him. The boat reached the packet,
Gingham went on board, the boatmen
made fast to a harbour-buoy, and
waited the result. Gingham went
below, made his arrangements, came
on deck, and hailed his boat to take
him ashore. The elder boatman
civilly touched his hat, and remarked,
with a winning smile, that they hadn't
been paid "nuffin" for bringing him
<i>on board</i>. Gingham replied, that he
should pay as usual when they had
got back to the quay. The boatman,
courteous as before, again touched his
hat, and answered, simpering, "Beg
your pardon, sir, but this ear last day,
when the peckit's hoff, jeddlemen hol-ways
pays bode ways, cumin aboard,
and goon back again." "Oh, do
they?" said Gingham, and walked
down into the cabin, where he quietly
wrote his note to me, in a hand that
beat copperplate; and breakfasted
upon sea biscuit, junk, and ship's
cocoa, the steward not having yet got
off his stock of groceries for the voyage.
Everybody on board knew Gingham,
and he had no difficulty in getting
his note brought ashore in the ship's
boat, without the knowledge of the
two 'longshore fellows, who were riding
at the buoy, and who still thought
they had the best of the bargain&mdash;as it
is a rule in harbour, or at any rate was
in those days, that no private passenger
by a packet passed or repassed
except by 'longshore boats. Gingham
was now all right, and did not care
one farthing for the boatmen; for he
already had the bulk of his things on
board, he was on board himself, and
his note advised me respecting his remaining
matters ashore. He continued
below, having resolved, as he told
me afterwards, to keep the boatmen
waiting alongside till the packet was
off, and then give them ninepence.
Meanwhile he sent up, by the steward,
an injunction to the people on deck,
who enjoyed not a little the false position
of the two boatmen, not on any
account to let them come on board.</p>

<p>Gingham's note to me, which was,
as I have already intimated, a beautiful
specimen of commercial penmanship,
was to the following effect:&mdash;That
he was detained on board by
his determination to resist a gross
imposition; that the laundress had
still in her keeping a small quantity
of his linen, which she was to bring
to the hotel about breakfast-time;
that he had settled with the servants
that morning; and that the landlady
was indebted to him in the sum of
two shillings, he having paid his bill
the night before, in which bill was
included the charge of two shillings
for a cold-meat breakfast, which he
should not take; that he requested
me to get back the two shillings from
the landlady; that he would also
thank me to receive the linen from
the laundress, see that it was correct
per invoice, (washing-bill, I presume,)
check her account, liquidate it, and
bring the linen on board with me.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a circumstance arose,
which was of great moment in itself,
and gave Gingham a further advantage
in his affair with the two Falmouth
lads. An extra mail for
Lisbon had arrived from London,
sent off by despatch to catch the
packet before she sailed; and, by
management of Gingham's partners,
who were influential people, brought
Gingham letters on a matter of some
importance. These letters were taken
off to Gingham by a trusty drab-coated
Falmouth "Friend," in another
'longshore boat, and rendered it absolutely
requisite that he should go
ashore, and perhaps defer his voyage.
The packet at this time was surrounded
with boats and bustle, the
two boatmen still fast to the buoy;
and Gingham had no difficulty in
returning ashore by the boat which
brought off his mercantile friend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>
without being observed by them.
In fact, they were half asleep, still
secure, as they thought, of their
victim, and affording no small sport
to the crew of the packet, who saw
how things were going. I shall only
mention here, that the communication,
received by Gingham from London,
related to a grand financial
speculation, an idea of his own,
having reference to the monetary
transactions at headquarters, which
were very large, and as well conducted
as circumstances permitted, but attended
with great difficulties, and
considerable loss to the British government.
Gingham's plan would have
been backed by private capital to any
amount. It was knocked on the head
by the peace of 1814: but I have more
to say about it hereafter.</p>

<p>True to her time, the laundress
arrived at the hotel; not bringing, as
Gingham had described it, a small
quantity of linen, but attended by a
man with a barrow, wheeling two
large buck-baskets, each piled with an
immense heap of shirts, white inexpressibles,
white double-breasted
dimity waistcoats,&mdash;in short every
thing white,&mdash;a stock for a voyage to
China. On the interior of the collar
of one of the said white double-breasted
dimity waistcoats, I noticed
the cypher</p>
<p><small>G G<br />
&nbsp;37</small>!&mdash;No. 1 of the fourth
dozen! So profuse was Gingham in
his provision for the habiliment of his
own elegant exterior. I settled with
the laundress, engaged the barrow-man
to go off with me in charge of
the linen, and take back the baskets,
finished my breakfast, paid my bill,
and went on board. Such was my
first embarkation for the Peninsula.
Little dreaming that there was a
spoke in my wheel, and that some time
was still to elapse between my departure
from Falmouth and my arrival
at the British headquarters, I had
longed for the day of the packet's
sailing. But now, when the wished-for
moment had arrived, a lot of little
things, coming upon me at the last,
quite put it out of my head that I was
quitting my native land, and about to
enter on new scenes, mingle with
strangers, embark in active life,
and master&mdash;where alone they could
be mastered, on their vernacular
soil&mdash;two ancient, expressive, and
kindred languages, which I had
conned rudimentally on the banks
of Cam. Nor did I dream that I
went to earn a prospective claim to
a Peninsular Medal; and jot down
mental memoranda, still vividly legible,
of all I heard and saw, for the information
and amusement of readers
then unborn. "Gooin' off to the
peckit, sir? Here, Bill, hand the
jeddleman's boxes." Then, when we
were half way to the brig,&mdash;"Wherry
'ot on the worter, sir. Ope you'll be
ginnerous a little hextry for the luggidge,
sir. Wherry dry work pullin',
sir."</p>

<p>Gingham, when I reached the
packet, was not on board. The cause
of his absence was explained to me
by the steward, who assisted in stowing
away the contents of the two
buck-baskets in Gingham's berth.
During this operation, the steward,
who fully participated in the antipathy
to 'longshore boatmen common
to his class, communicated to me,
with no small glee, the occurrences of
the morning; and begged me to take
a sight, when I went on deck, of the
two expectant gentlemen at the buoy.
There they were, sure enough, very
much at their ease&mdash;quite satisfied
that Gingham would want to be taken
ashore again before the packet sailed,
that theirs was the boat that must
take him, and that they had the game
in their own hands.</p>

<p>On deck I met our three breakfast
guests of the day before. They
greeted me cordially, made many
inquiries after Gingham, and introduced
me, as a particular old crony
of theirs, to Staff-Surgeon Pledget,
who had arrived by the mail overnight,
and was also a passenger to
Lisbon, on his return to the British
army. I soon began to perceive that
it was a standing rule with my three
new acquaintances, regular "Peninsulars,"
to extract fun from even the
most common incidents&mdash;in fact, from
everybody and everything. Staff-Surgeon
Pledget, as able a man in
his profession as any staff-surgeon
attached to the Peninsular army, was
matter-of-fact personified; and the
dignified cordiality with which he
received an old crony of <i>theirs</i>, evidently
afforded the three hoaxers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>
extraordinary sport. Major M&mdash;&mdash; did
the presentation with perfect coolness
and amenity. Gammon was his
element. Mr Commissary Capsicum
winked his eye in the richest style of
comedy, and nearly made me spoil
all by laughing. Captain Gabion
looked gravely on, and laughed internally.
His sides shook, his elbows
twitched, and his countenance wore
its usual expression of melancholy.</p>

<p>Presently after was seen approaching
a man-of-war's boat, pulling at
the steady rate, which indicated that
it conveyed an officer of rank. The
boat came alongside with a graceful
sweep; twelve oars stood upright, as
if by magic; and a tall, military-looking
man, who had lost an arm, rose,
politely took leave of the lieutenant in
charge of the boat, ascended the ship's
side, with the aid of his single hand,
faster than some people perform the
same difficult operation with two,
and stood on deck. This was the
brave Colonel &mdash;&mdash; of the cavalry,
who was going out with us to rejoin
his regiment. He had lost his arm at
Oporto, on that memorable occasion
when the French, to their astonishment,
found the British army on <i>their</i>
side of the Douro; and when the
British army, too, quite surprised at
finding itself, as if by magic, on
the <i>opposite</i> bank of a broad, deep,
and rapid river, and struck with admiration
at the bold conception and
skilful execution which had effected
the transition under the enemy's
nose, with one consent dubbed its
illustrious leader "Old Douro." By
that title, from that time forward, he
was commonly known at headquarters:
and is it not a glorious one, so
won, and so conferred, and truly worthy
of descending in his family? On
that occasion, I was told, Colonel
---- charged through the enemy at
the head of his regiment, and, as
one good turn deserves another,
thought he might as well charge back
again. It was in this second charge
that he lost his arm.</p>

<p>Arrived on deck, the colonel made
a somewhat semicircular bow to all of
us, and immediately recognised Major
M&mdash;&mdash;. His valet followed him, and
presently went below. The next moment,
the colonel began to take a first
view of the vessel, and turned from
us for that purpose. Captain Gabion,
first nudging Mr Commissary Capsicum,
whispered Major M&mdash;&mdash;, "Come,
major, give us the colonel." The
major, having an arm too many, in a
twinkling whipped one behind him,
stepped to the gangway, and did the
colonel's first appearance to the life.
To execute the colonel's recognition of
himself, for want of a better substitute,
he advanced, with the colonel's three
military strides, to <i>me</i>. I, carried
away by the drollery of the scene, so
far forgot myself that I did the major.
This caused a general laugh; the
colonel turned round, and caught me
and the major bowing, grimacing, and
shaking hands. He saw at once what
had been going on, and laughed too.
But the major wished to shift the
responsibility. "That Pledget," said
he, "keeps us in a constant roar."
Mr Staff-Surgeon Pledget looked a
little surprised. When the major gave
us the colonel's horizontal salutation to
the company assembled, Pledget took
it all in earnest, and bowed in return.</p>

<p>One other arrival followed. A shore
boat came off, having four more passengers&mdash;a
lady, two gentlemen, and
a female attendant. One of the said
gentlemen, an Irishman, was the
lady's brother: she, in face and form,
a perfect specimen of Irish beauty;
he, both in person and in feature, all
that might be expected in the brother
of such a sister. In this respect he
presented a remarkable contrast to
their fellow-passenger, who was a
young Irish officer of the East India
Company's navy, and, what made it
more remarkable, the accepted swain,
as we afterwards had every reason to
conclude, of his fair countrywoman.
How shall I describe this lovely youth?
His head was large; his face prodigiously
large and <i>flat</i>; his features were ludicrously
diminutive. Fancy a full
moon seen broad and white through a
Shetland mist&mdash;in short, a full moon
of putty; then fancy, stuck exactly
in the centre of this moon, the little
screwed-up pug face of a little ugly
monkey, and you have him to a T.
His two little twinkling eyes, deep
sunk beneath the beetling brow of his
prominent and massive forehead, and
in such close proximity that nothing
separated them but the bridge of his
nose, were constantly and inquisitively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
on the move. The nose itself was too
insignificant to merit a description.
Yet it was not exactly what is called
a squashed nose, but a nose without a
nib. It conveyed to you, indeed, the
painful impression that some unfeeling
barber had sliced off its extremity,
and left the two unprotected nostrils
staring you full in the face, like the
open ports of a ship. His ears were
like an elephant's,&mdash;large, loose, thin,
flat, and un-hemmed. His mouth, like
that described by a distinguished authoress,
"had a physiognomy of its
own." Not very observable when
quiescent, in speaking it became
curiously expressive, and, at times,
enormously elongated or strangely
curvilinear. It had also, under the
same circumstances, another peculiarity.
It was a travelling mouth:
yes, it travelled. When it talked, it
was constantly shifting its position,
not only up and down, but sideways
and obliquely. In the utterance
of a single sentence, it would
traverse the whole extent of his
face. It was now high, now low;
now on this side, now on that. It
ranged, at will, the whole breadth of
his countenance from ear to ear; so
that at times he was all mouth on
one side of his face, and no mouth on
the other. This gave him the additional
advantage, that his profile could
maintain a dialogue with you, as well
as another man's full face. When
conversing with his lady-love, side
by side at the dinner-table, he never
turned to look at her&mdash;he had no need.
Viewing her with one eye, like a duck,
in tones of deferential tenderness he
addressed her from the cheek that
was nearest hers. His perfectly
well-bred deportment, nay, elegance
of manner, his inexhaustible fund of
good humour, and amusing waggery,
did not, I am sorry to say, prevent
his acquiring, and bearing during the
voyage, the name of Joey: allusive,
I presume, to the feats of mouth performed
in those days by the far-famed
Grimaldi. The malevolent
suspicion, that a title so derogatory
was any suggestion of mine, I scorn
to notice. To this, however, I do
confess, that, ere we had been four-and-twenty
hours at sea, as a slight
token of my profound veneration for
the stateliest and the loveliest of
Erin's daughters, I proposed, and it
was carried unanimously, that she
should bear the name of Juno. And,
the colonel having pronounced her
brother a perfect Apollo, I also proposed,
and it was also carried unanimously,
that we should call him Mr
Belvidere. But I am anticipating.
On the practice of giving sobriquets,
so common at headquarters, much
remains to be said hereafter. As to
the maid-servant, she was a quiet
little Irishwoman of about five-and-thirty,
in a duffle cloak with pink
bows, snug straw bonnet neatly tied
under her chin with a pink ribbon,
and snow-white cotton stockings, exhibiting
a rather broad instep, which
led me to conjecture that she had not
always worn shoes. Her mistress
called her Kitty, and that name she
was allowed to keep, as no one on
board thought he could improve it.</p>

<p>It is time to get to sea. Gingham,
where are you? what are you about?
We shall be off, and leave you behind.
Noon, our hour of sailing,
was now near at hand. The anchor
was hove short; the sails were shaking
in the wind; the skipper came
on board; the foresail was then set;
still there was no Gingham. Those
talented individuals, the two boatmen,
still supposing Gingham was on board,
were getting a little uneasy. They
were now wide awake, and anxiously
peering at the ship with their hands
over their eyes, watching every one
that came on deck, but watching in
vain. Their uneasiness evidently
increased, as our remaining time diminished;
till at length, as the town
clock struck twelve, the capstan was
manned. The anchor was then hove
to the tune of "Off she goes," performed
on a single fife in admirable
time, marked by the tread of many
feet. The flood-tide was beginning
to make; but we didn't care for that,
as we had wind enough from the north-east,
and to spare. Other sails were
now set, and we were beginning to
get way; while I was intently eyeing
the shore, expecting to see Gingham
shove off, and perfectly sure he would
come, because he had taken no steps
for the re-landing of his baggage.</p>

<p>But I did not look in the right direction.
Gingham, detained to the
last moment, and then, having settled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>
all things to his satisfaction, at liberty
to prosecute his voyage, had made
his arrangements with his usual judgment.
It was a near thing though.
He put off from a part of the town
lower down than the quay from which
he usually embarked, so as to cut in
upon us as we glided down the harbour;
and was within a few fathoms
of the ship before I saw him. He
was then standing upright in his boat,
completely absorbed in a London
paper, but with one hand waving his
umbrella, without looking up, to stop
the ship. Stopping the ship was out
of the question. Indeed, I fancied the
skipper would have been glad to go
without him. The boat, coming end
on, and not very cleverly handled by
the Falmouth fellows, bumped against
the side of the ship, which, as she
was now under way, they were afraid
of missing altogether; and the shock
almost pitched Gingham and his
umbrella into the water. He came
on board amidst general laughter,
and the hearty greetings of such of
the passengers as knew him&mdash;none
heartier than mine. "How his green
spectacles would have frightened the
fishes!" said Mr Commissary Capsicum
to Captain Gabion. "Don't
joke on such a serious subject," replied
the captain; "had he gone
over, we should have quitted England
without getting a sight of the last
London newspaper."</p>

<p>The two worthies, who, still
expecting to see Gingham emerge
from the cabin, had so long waited
for him in vain, were by this
time in an awkward predicament.
When the ship first began to move,
they had no resource but to unmoor
from the buoy, out oars, and pull
away in company. But this, it was
soon clear, would not do. The ship
was getting more and more way, and,
had they pulled their hearts out, would
soon have left them astern; when,
as their only chance, they pulled close
alongside, and made free with a rope's
end that was dragging through the
water. This one of them held, after
giving it a turn round a bench; while
the other kept off the boat from the
ship's side by means of the boat-hook.
While they were being thus dragged
through the water, each, as he could,
from time to time touching his hat,
each beseechingly simpering, each
saying something that nobody could
hear, and both anxiously looking for
Gingham on deck, to their great surprise
they saw him come alongside in
another boat, as I have already related;
and, before they could say
Jack Robinson, he was on board.</p>

<p>After our first greetings, I called
Gingham's attention to the disagreeable
position of our two friends, who
were still holding on alongside, and
dragging through the water. Indeed,
I was disposed to hold an argument
with him on the subject, and thought
a different view might be taken of
their case. "No, no," said Gingham;
"this is the first time any Falmouth
man has ever attempted to impose
upon me, and I mean it to be the last."</p>

<p>The breeze, no unusual circumstance
in such localities, stiffened as we approached
the entrance of the harbour,
where the high land closes in, and the
sea-way is comparatively narrow;
and, meeting the swell which came
tumbling in from the ocean with the
flood-tide, knocked up a little bit of
an ugly ripple. The situation of the
two boatmen was becoming every
moment more awkward. We were
now going six knots, (through the
<i>water</i>, mind you, not <i>making</i> six knots&mdash;that,
against such a current, was
quite beyond our tubby little Wilhelmina's
capabilities;) the ripple was
gradually becoming nastier; the boatmen,
still touching their hats from
time to time, still blandly smiling,
and still making unheard but pathetic
appeals to Gingham's generosity, did
not like to let go till they had got
<i>something</i>; and I really thought the
end must be, that their boat would
be swamped alongside. At length,
Gingham put an end to the farce,
by screwing up ninepence in a bit of
paper, and throwing it into the boat,
telling them it was threepence more
than they deserved. They then let
go; and we left them poppling up and
down, like a cork, in the broken water,
and scuffling about in the bottom of
the boat for the scattered coin.</p>

The fabulous dragon has long acted a conspicuous part in the poetry both of the
north and south. We find him in the legends of Regnar Lodbrog and Kempion, and
in the episode of Brandimarte in the second book of the Orlando Inamorato. He is
also to be recognised as the huge snake of the Edda; and figures with ourselves in
the stories of the Chevalier St George and the Dragon&mdash;of Moor of Moorhall and the
Dragon of Wantley&mdash;in the Dragon of Loriton&mdash;in the Laidley Worm of Spindleton
Heugh&mdash;in the Flying Serpent of Lockburne&mdash;the Snake of Wormieston, &amp;c. &amp;c.
Bartholinus and Saxo-Grammaticus volunteer us some curious information regarding
a species of these monsters, whose particular office was to keep watch over hidden
treasure. The winged Gryphon is of "auld descent," and has held a place in unnatural

"Like, but oh how different," are these unearthly goings on to the details in the Walpurgis
Night of Faust (Act v. Scene 1.) The "phantom-hunters" of the north were
not the "Wilde J&auml;ger" of Burger, or "the Erl-king" of Goethe. It is related by
Hearne, that the tribes of the Chippewas Indians suppose the northern lights to be
occasioned by the frisking of herds of deer in the fields above, caused by the hallo

Jedburgh Castle, on the night when Alexander III., in 1286, espoused as his second
queen, Joleta, daughter of the Count le Dreux. These were the palmy days of portents;

occurred, only a few months after the appearance of the skeleton masquer, by a fall
from his horse, over a precipice, while hunting between Burntisland and Kinghorn, at
a place still called "the King's Wood-end."

<p>Another book from the active pen
of our American acquaintance, the
able seaman. The question having
been raised whether Mr Herman Melville
has really served before the mast,
and has actually, like the heroine of a
well-known pathetic ballad, disfigured
his lily-white fingers with the nasty
pitch and tar, he does his best to dissipate
all such doubts by the title-page
of his new work, on which, in large
capitals, is proclaimed that <i>Redburn</i>
is "<i>The Sailor-boy Confessions and
Reminiscences of the son of a gentleman
in the merchant service</i>;" and, collaterally,
by a dedication to his younger
brother, "<i>now a sailor on a voyage to
China</i>." An unmerited importance
has perhaps been given to the inquiry
whether Mr Melville's voyages were
made on quarterdeck or on forecastle,
and are genuine adventures or mere
Robinsonades. The book, not the
writer, concerns the critic; and even
as there assuredly are circumstances
that might induce a youth of gentle
birth and breeding to don flannel shirt,
and put fist in tar-bucket as a merchant
seaman, so the probably unpleasant
nature of those circumstances
precludes too inquisitive investigation
into them. We accept Mr Melville,
therefore, for what he professes to be,
and we accept his books, also, with
pleasure and gratitude when good,
just as we neglect and reject them
when they are the contrary. <i>Redburn</i>,
we are bound to admit, is entitled to
a more favourable verdict than the
author's last previous work. We do
not like it so well as <i>Typee</i> and <i>Omoo</i>;
and, although quite aware that this is
a class of fiction to which one cannot
often return without finding it pall, by
reason of a certain inevitable sameness,
we yet are quite sure we should
not have liked it so well as those two
books, even though priority of publication
had brought it to a palate unsated
with that particular sort of literary
diet. Nevertheless, after a decided
and deplorable retrogression, Mr
Melville seems likely to go a-head
again, if he will only take time and
pains, and not over-write himself, and
avoid certain affectations and pedantry
unworthy a man of his ability. Many
of the defects of <i>Mardi</i> are corrected
in <i>Redburn</i>. We gladly miss much
of the obscurity and nonsense that
abound in the former work. The
style, too, of this one is more natural
and manly; and even in the minor
matter of a title, we find reason to
congratulate Mr Melville on improved
taste, inasmuch as we think an English
book is better fitted with an English-sounding
name than with uncouth
dissyllables from Polynesia, however
convenient these may be found for the
purposes of the puff provocative.</p>

<p><i>Redburn</i> comprises four months of
the life of a hardy wrong-headed
lad, who ships himself on board a
trading vessel, for the voyage from
New York to Liverpool and back.
As there is no question of shipwreck,
storm, pirates, mutiny, or any other
nautico-dramatic incidents, during
Wellingborough Redburn's voyage out
and home; and as the events of his
brief abode in England are neither
numerous nor (with the exception of
one rather far-fetched episode) by any
means extraordinary, it is evident
that a good deal of detail and ingenuity
are necessary to fill two volumes,
on so simple and commonplace a
theme. So a chapter is devoted to
the causes of his addiction to the sea,
and shows how it was that childish
reminiscences of a seaport town, and
stories of maritime adventure told him
by his father, who had many times
crossed the Atlantic, and visions of
European magnificence, and, above
all, the frequent contemplation of an
old-fashioned glass ship which stood
in his mother's sitting-room, and
which is described with considerable
minuteness, and some rather feeble
attempts at the facetious&mdash;how all
these things combined had imbued
young Wellingborough with a strong
craving after salt water. Other circumstances
concurred to drive him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>forth upon the world. He hints at
family misfortunes. His father had
been a merchant at New York, in a
flourishing business. Things were
now less prosperous. "Some time
previous, my mother had removed
from New York to a pleasant village
on the Hudson river, where we lived
in a small house, in a quiet way. Sad
disappointments in several plans which
I had sketched for my future life; the
necessity of doing something for myself,
united to a naturally roving disposition,
had now conspired within
me to send me to sea as a sailor."
And yet it would appear that he might
have done better than plunge thus
recklessly into the hardships and evil
associations of a merchantman's forecastle;
for he more than half admits
that he was erring and wilful, and that
he had kind relatives and sympathising
patrons, who would have put him
in the way of earning a living otherwise.
Redburn, however, seems to
have been in some respects as precocious
as in others we shall presently
find him simple and inexperienced. A
mere boy, adversity had already converted
him into a misanthrope, at an
age when most lads are as yet without
plans for their future, and know not
disappointment in any more important
matters than a treat to the play, or an
extra week's holiday. The forwardness
of the rising generation is remarkable
enough in England, and has been
amusingly hit off by one of our cleverest
caricaturists. In America, therefore,
which notoriously goes a-head of
the old country in most particulars,
and whose inhabitants lay claim to an
extraordinary share of railroad and
earthquake in their composition, boyish
precocity is possibly still more remarkable;
and one must not wonder
at finding Master Redburn talking in
misanthropic vein of the world's treatment
of him, how bleak and cheerless
everything seemed, and how "the
warm soul of him had been flogged out
by adversity." This, at an age when
the stinging memory of the schoolmaster's
taws must still have been
tolerably vivid about the seat of his
breeks, seems rather absurd to begin
with. It was under the influence of
such feelings, however, that this infant
Timon left his home to cast his lot
upon the wide waters. His friends
were evidently either very angry with
him or very poor; for they allowed
him to depart with but one dollar in
his pocket, a big shooting-jacket with
foxes' heads on the buttons, and a
little bundle, containing his entire kit,
slung at the end of the fowling-piece
which his good-natured elder brother
pressed upon him at parting. Thus
equipped, he tramps of to the steamer
that is to carry him down the Hudson,
early on a raw morning, along a muddy
road, and through a drizzling rain.
The skyey influences will at times
affect even the most stoical, and the
dismal aspect of external nature makes
Master Redburn revert to his blighted
prospects&mdash;how his soul is afflicted
with mildew, "and the fruit which,
with others, is only blasted after ripeness,
with him is nipped in the first
blossom and bud." The blight he
complains of is evidently of a most
virulent description, for it "leaves
such a scar that the air of Paradise
might not erase it." As he has just
before told us how, whilst walking
along, his fingers "worked moodily
at the stock and trigger" of his brother's
rifle, and that he had thought
this was indeed "the proper way to
begin life, with a gun in your hand,"
we feel, upon hearing him croak so
desperately, some apprehension for
his personal safety, and think his brother
would have done as well to have
kept his gun. On this last point we
quite make up our minds, when we
shortly afterwards find him levelling
the weapon at the left eye of a steamboat
passenger who is so imprudent
as to stare at him, and bullying the
steward for demanding the fare,
(which is two dollars, whereas Redburn
has but one,) and looking cat-a-mounts
at his less needy fellow-voyagers,
because they have the rudeness
to enjoy their roast beef dinner,
whilst he has had the improvidence to
leave home without even a crust in
his wallet. It seems the author's aim
to start his hero in life under every
possible circumstance of disadvantage
and hardship; and to do this, he
rather loses sight of probability. At
last, however, Redburn reaches New
York, with gun and bundle, foxes'
heads and shooting-jacket, and hastens
to visit a friend of his brother's,
to whom he is recommended. A kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>
welcome, good supper, and warm bed,
go some way towards dissipating his
ill humour; and next morning the
friend accompanies him to the docks
to seek a ship. But none of his
brother's kindnesses prosper him.
The gun, as we have seen, has already
led him to the verge of homicide, the
foxes' heads are yet to be the source
of innumerable vexations; and Mr
Jones, a silly young man, does more
harm than good, by taking the direction
of Redburn's affairs, and acting
as his spokesman with Captain Riga,
of the regular trader, <i>Highlander</i>,
then loading for Liverpool.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We found the captain in the cabin,
which was a very handsome one, lined
with mahogany and maple; and the
steward, an elegant-looking mulatto, in a
gorgeous turban, was setting out, on a
sort of sideboard, some dinner-service
which looked like silver, but it was only
Britannia ware highly polished. As soon
as I clapped my eye on the captain, I
thought to myself he was just the captain
to suit me. He was a fine-looking
man, about forty, splendidly dressed,
with very black whiskers and very white
teeth, and what I took to be a free frank
look out of a large hazel eye. I liked
him amazingly."</p></blockquote>

<p>The scene that ensues is quietly
humorous, and reminds us a good
deal of Marryat, in whose style of
novel we think Mr Melville would
succeed. The upshot of the conference
is that Redburn ships as a boy
on board the Highlander. By vaunting
his respectability, and the wealth
of his relations, his injudicious friend
furnishes Riga with a pretext for
withholding the customary advance
of pay; and although the sale of the
fowling-piece to a Jew pawnbroker
produces wherewith to purchase a
red woollen shirt, a tarpaulin hat,
and jack-knife, Redburn goes on
board but slenderly provided. His
reception is not very cheering.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When I reached the deck, I saw no
one but a large man in a large dripping
pea-jacket, who was calking down the
main-hatches.</p>

<p>"'What do you want, Pillgarlic?'
said he.</p>

<p>"'I've shipped to sail in this ship,' I
replied, assuming a little dignity to chastise
his familiarity.</p>

<p>"'What for&mdash;a tailor?' said he, looking
at my shooting-jacket.</p>

<p>"I answered that I was going as a
'boy;' for so I was technically put down
on the articles.</p>

<p>"'Well,' said he, 'have you got your
traps aboard?'</p>

<p>"I told him I didn't know there were
any rats in the ship, and hadn't brought
any 'trap.'</p>

<p>"At this he laughed out with a great
guffaw, and said there must be hay-seed
in my hair.</p>

<p>"This made me mad; but, thinking he
must be one of the sailors who was going
in the ship, I thought it wouldn't be
wise to make an enemy of him, so only
asked him where the men slept in the
vessel, for I wanted to put my clothes
away.</p>

<p>"'Where's your clothes?' said he.</p>

<p>"'Here in my bundle,' said I, holding
it up.</p>

<p>"'Well, if that's all you've got,' he
cried, 'you'd better chuck it overboard.
But go forward, go forward to the forecastle;
that's the place you live in aboard
here.'</p>

<p>"And with that he directed me to a
sort of hole in the deck of the bow of the
ship; but looking down, and seeing how
dark it was, I asked him for a light.</p>

<p>"'Strike your eyes together and make
one,' said he, 'we don't have any lights
here.' So I groped my way down into
the forecastle, which smelt so bad of old
ropes and tar, that it almost made me
sick. After waiting patiently, I began
to see a little; and, looking round, at last
perceived I was in a smoky-looking place,
with twelve wooden boxes stuck round
the sides. In some of these boxes were
large chests, which I at once supposed to
belong to the sailors, who must have
taken that method of appropriating their
'bunks,' as I afterwards found these
boxes were called. And so it turned
out.</p>

<p>"After examining them for a while, I
selected an empty one, and put my bundle
right in the middle of it, so that there
might be no mistake about my claim to
the place, particularly as the bundle was
so small."</p></blockquote>

<p>The ship is not to sail till the next
day; the crew are not yet aboard;
there is no mess, and Redburn has no
money. He passes a wretched night
in his evil-smelling bunk, and next
morning is crawling about the deck,
weak from hunger, when he is accosted
by the first mate, who curses him for
a lubber, asks his name, swears it is
too long to be handy, rebaptizes him
by that of <i>Buttons</i>, and sets him to
clean out the pig-pen, and grease the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>
main-topmast. Having accomplished
these savoury duties, and narrowly
escaped falling overboard from his
unwonted elevation, Redburn is
ordered to the quarterdeck, where
the men are divided into watches,
and he falls to the lot of his friend
the first mate, who tries hard to get
rid of him to Mr Rigs, the second
mate; but Mr Rigs refuses the tyro,
even as a free gift. Redburn now
gets sea-sick, and, when ordered on
deck to stand the first night-watch,
from eight o'clock to midnight, he,
feeling qualmish, requests one of the
sailors to make his excuses very
civilly to the chief mate, for that he
thinks he will go below and spend
the night in his bunk. The sailor, a
good-natured Greenlander, laughs at
his simplicity, and doctors him with
a canikin of rum and some ship biscuits,
which enable him to get through
his watch. Minute incidents of this
kind, reflections, reminiscences, and
thoughts of home, occupy many
chapters; and, at times, one is inclined
to think they are dwelt upon
at too great length: but, as before
hinted, it is necessary to do something
to fill two volumes. A slight inconsistency
strikes us in this first portion
of the book. Redburn, a sharp
enough lad on shore, and who, it has
been seen, is altogether precocious
in experience of the world's disappointments,
seems converted, by the
first sniff of salt water, into as arrant
a simpleton as ever made mirth in a
cockpit. Mr Melville must surely
have had Peter Simple in his head,
when describing "Buttons" at his
first deck-washing. "The water
began to splash about all over the
decks, and I began to think I should
surely get my feet wet, and catch my
death of cold. So I went to the
chief mate and told him I thought
I would just step below, till this
miserable wetting was over; for I
did not have any waterproof boots,
and an aunt of mine had died of consumption.
But he only roared out
for me to get a broom, and go to
scrubbing, or he would prove a worse
consumption to me than ever got hold
of my poor aunt." Now Redburn,
from what has previously been seen
of him, was evidently not the lad to
care a rush about wet soles, or even
about a thorough ducking. On the
Hudson river steamer, he had voluntarily
walked the deck in a dreary
storm till soaked through; and his
first night on board the Highlander
had been passed uncomplainingly in
wet clothes. He has borne hunger
and thirst and other disagreeables
most manfully, and the impression
given of him is quite that of a stubborn
hardy fellow. So that this sudden
fear of a splashing is evidently
introduced merely to afford Mr Melville
opportunity of making a little
mild fun, and is altogether out of
character. Equally so is the elaborate
<i>naivet&eacute;</i> with which Redburn inquires
of a sailor whether, as the big bell
on the forecastle "hung right over
the scuttle that went down to the
place where the watch below were
sleeping, such a ringing every little
while would not tend to disturb them,
and beget unpleasant dreams." The
account of his attempts at intimacy
with the captain, although humorous
enough, is liable to a similar objection;
and, in so sharp a lad, such
simple blunders are not sufficiently
accounted for by ignorance of sea
usages. His recollection of the bland
urbanity with which Captain Riga
had received him and Mr Jones, when
they first boarded the Highlander,
induces him to believe that he may
reckon on sympathy and attention in
that quarter, when bullied by the
rough sailors, and abused by the
snappish mate. He had vague ideas
of Sunday dinners in the cabin, of an
occasional lesson in navigation, or an
evening game at chess. Desirous to
realise these pleasant visions, but observing
that the captain takes no
notice of him, and altogether omits to
invite him aft, Buttons, as he is
now universally called on board the
trader, thinks it may be expected that
he, the younger man, should make the
first advances. His pig-sty and
chicken-coop cleanings have not greatly
improved the aspect of his clothes, or
the colour of his hands; but a bucket
of water gets off the worst of the
stains, and a selection from his limited
wardrobe converts him into a decent
enough figure for a forecastle, although
he still would not have excited much
admiration in Broadway or Bond
Street.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When the sailors saw me thus employed,
they did not know what to make
of it, and wanted to know whether I
was dressing to go ashore. I told them
no, for we were then out of sight of
land, but that I was going to pay my
respects to the captain. Upon which
they all laughed and shouted, as if I
were a simpleton; although there seemed
nothing so very simple in going to make an
evening call upon a friend. When some
of them tried to dissuade me, saying I
was green and raw; but Jackson, who
sat looking on, cried out with a hideous
grin&mdash;'Let him go, let him go, men; he's
a nice boy. Let him go; the captain has
some nuts and raisins for him.' And so
he was going on, when one of his violent
fits of coughing seized him, and he almost
choked.... For want of kids, I
slipped on a pair of woollen mittens,
which my mother had knit for me to carry
to sea. As I was putting them on,
Jackson asked me whether he shouldn't
call a carriage; and another bade me
not forget to present his best respects to
the skipper. I left them all tittering,
and, coming on deck, was passing the
cook-house, when the old cook called
after me, saying I had forgot my cane."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Jackson here referred to is a
prominent character in the book, an
important personage amongst the inmates
of the Highlander's forecastle.
He was a yellow-visaged, whiskerless,
squinting, broken-nosed ruffian, and
his head was bald, "except in the
nape of his neck and just behind the
ears, where it was stuck over with
short little tufts, and looked like a
worn-out shoe-brush." He claimed
near relationship with General Jackson,
was a good seaman and a great
bully, and, although physically weak,
and broken down by excess and disease,
the other sailors gave way to,
and even petted him. He had been
at sea ever since his early childhood,
and he told strange wild tales of his
experiences in many lands and on
many distant seas, and of perils encountered
in Portuguese slavers on
the African coast, and of Batavian
fevers and Malay pirates, and the like
horrible things, which composed, indeed,
all his conversation, save when
he found fault with his shipmates, and
cursed, and reviled, and jeered at them&mdash;all
of which they patiently endured,
as though they feared the devil that
glared out of "his deep, subtle, infernal-looking
eye." All who have read
<i>Omoo</i>, (the best of Mr Melville's
books,) will remember that the author
is an adept in the sketching of nautical
originals. Jackson is by no means a
bad portrait, and doubtless he is
"founded on fact;" although much of
his savage picturesqueness may be
attributed to the clever pencil of his
former shipmate. Riga is another
good hit. The handsome captain,
with the fine clothes and the shining
black whiskers, who spoke so smooth
and looked so sleek when his craft lay
moored by New York quay, is altogether
another sort of character when
once the anchor is up. Seamen never
judge a captain by his shore-going
looks. Tyrants and martinets afloat are
often all simper and benevolence across
a mahogany plank ashore. But certainly
there never was a more thorough
metamorphosis than a four-and-twenty
hours' sail produced in Captain Riga.
His glossy suit and gallant airs disappeared
altogether. "He wore nothing
but old-fashioned snuff-coloured
coats, with high collars and short
waists, and faded short-legged pantaloons,
very tight about the knees, and
vests that did not conceal his waistbands,
owing to their being so short,
just like a little boy's. And his hats
were all caved in and battered, as if
they had been knocked about in a
cellar, and his boots were sadly
patched. Indeed, I began to think he
was but a shabby fellow after all, particularly
as his whiskers lost their
gloss, and he went days together
without shaving; and his hair, by a
sort of miracle, began to grow of a
pepper and salt colour, which might
have been owing, though, to his discontinuing
the use of some kind of dye
while at sea. I put him down as a
sort of impostor." This the captain
certainly is, and ultimately proves to
be something worse, for he swindles
poor Buttons and another unfortunate
"boy" out of their hard-earned wages,
and proves himself altogether a far
worse fellow than the rough mate,
whose first salutation is often a curse
or a cuff, but who, nevertheless, has
some heart and humanity under his
coarse envelope. Of various other
individuals of the ship's company
sketches are given, and prominent
amongst these is the dandy mulatto
steward, called Lavender by the crew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
from his having been a barber in New
York. Following the example of the
captain, whose immediate dependant
he is, Lavender, when at sea, lays by
his gorgeous turban, and sports his
wool, profusely scented with the residue
of his stock in trade. "He was
a sentimental sort of darky, and read
the <i>Three Spaniards</i> and <i>Charlotte
Temple</i>, and carried a lock of frizzled
hair in his vest pocket, which he frequently
volunteered to show to people,
with his handkerchief to his eyes."
It must have been sympathy of race,
not congeniality of disposition, that
made cronies of Lavender and the
methodistical black cook. Thompson,
the sable Soyer of the <i>Highlander</i>, was
known as the Doctor, according to the
nautical practice of confounding the
medical and the gastronomical professions.
He is a capital portrait,
scarcely caricatured. On a Sunday
morning, "he sat over his boiling
pots, reading out of a book which was
very much soiled, and covered with
grease spots, for he kept it stuck into
a little leather strap, nailed to the keg
where he kept the fat skimmed off the
water in which the salt beef was cooked."
This book was the Bible, and
what with the heat of the five-feet-square
kitchen, and his violent efforts
to comprehend the more mysterious
passages of scripture, the beads of
sweat would roll off the Doctor's brow
as he sat upon a narrow shelf, opposite
the stove, and so close to it that
he had to spread his legs out wide to
keep them from scorching. During
the whole voyage he was never known
to wash his face but once, and that
was on a dark night, in one of his own
soup-pots. His coffee, by courtesy so
called, was a most extraordinary compound,
and would not bear analysis.
Sometimes it tasted fishy, at others
salt; then it would have a cheesy
flavour, or&mdash;but we abridge the unsavoury
details with which Redburn
disgusts us upon this head. Sambo's
devotional practices precluded due
attention to his culinary duties. For
his narrow caboose he entertained a
warm affection. "In fair weather he
spread the skirt of an old jacket before
the door by way of a mat, and screwed
a small ringbolt into the door for a
knocker, and wrote his name, 'Mr
Thompson,' over it, with a bit of red
chalk." The old negro stands before
us as we read; cooking, praying, perspiring,
and with all the ludicrous
self-sufficiency of his tribe. Mr Melville
is very happy in these little
touches. Max the Dutchman is another
original. Although married to
two highly respectable wives, one at
Liverpool and the other at New York,
at sea he is quite an old bachelor,
precise and finical, with old-fashioned
straight-laced notions about the duties
of sailor boys, which he tries hard to
inculcate upon Redburn. Upon the
whole, however, Red Max, as he is
sometimes called&mdash;his shirt, cheeks,
hair, and whiskers being all of that
colour&mdash;is tolerably kind to the youngster,
in whose welfare he occasionally
shows some little interest. Jack
Blunt, to whose description the author
devotes the greater part of a chapter,
is not quite so happy a hit&mdash;rather
overdone&mdash;overloaded with peculiarities.
Although quite a young fellow,
his hair is turning gray, and, to check
this premature sign of age, he thrice
in the day anoints his bushy locks
with <i>Trafalgar Oil</i> and <i>Copenhagen
Elixir</i>, invaluable preparations retailed
to him by a knavish Yankee apothecary.
He is also greatly addicted to
drugging himself: takes three pills
every morning with his coffee, and
every now and then pours down "a
flowing bumper of <i>horse salts</i>." Then
he has a turn for romance, and sings
sentimental songs, which must have
had an odd enough sound from the
lips of one whose general appearance
is that of "a fat porpoise standing on
end;" and he believes in witchcraft,
and studies a dream-book, and mutters
Irish invocations for a breeze when
the ship is becalmed, &amp;c., &amp;c. Rather
much of all this, Mr Melville, and not
equal, by a long chalk, to what you
once before did in the same line. As
we read, we cannot help a comparison
with some former pencillings of yours,
which, although earlier made, referred
to a later voyage. Involuntarily we
are carried back to the rat-and-cockroach-haunted
hull of the crazy little
Jule, and to the strange collection of
originals that therein did dwell. We
think of bold Jermin and timid Captain
Guy, and, above all, of that glorious
fellow Doctor Long-Ghost. We
remember the easy natural tone, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>
well-sustained interest of the book in
which they figured; and, desirous
though we are to praise, we are compelled
to admit that, in <i>Redburn</i>, Mr
Melville comes not up to the mark he
himself has made. It is evident that,
on his debut, he threw off the rich
cream of his experiences, and he must
not marvel if readers have thereby
been rendered dainty, and grumble a
little when served with the skim-milk.
<i>Redburn</i> is a clever book, as books
now go, and we are far from visiting
it with wholesale condemnation; but
it certainly lacks the spontaneous
flow and racy originality of the author's
South Sea narration.</p>

<p>To proceed, however. "<i>Redburn
grows intolerably flat and stupid over
some outlandish old guide-books.</i>" Such
is the heading of Chapter XXX.; and,
from what Mr Melville says, we do
not, in this instance, presume to differ.
We are now in Liverpool. Much
of what Redburn there sees, says, and
does, will be more interesting to
American than to English readers, although
to many even of the latter
there will be novelty in his minute
account of sailor life ashore&mdash;of their
boarding-houses, haunts, and habits;
of the German emigrant ships, and the
salt-droghers and Lascars, and of
other matters seemingly commonplace,
but in which his observant eye
detects much that escapes ordinary
gazers. We ourselves, to whom the
aspect and ways of the great trading
city of northern England are by no
means unfamiliar, have derived some
new lights from Redburn's account of
what he there saw. Clergymen of the
Church of England, we are informed,
stand up on old casks, at quay corners,
arrayed in full canonicals, and preach
thus, <i>al fresco</i>, to sailors and loose
women. Paupers are allowed to linger
and perish unaided, almost in the
public thoroughfare, within sight and
knowledge of neighbours and police.
Curious, seemingly, of the horrible,
Redburn visits the dead-house, where
he sees "a sailor stretched out, stark
and stiff, with the sleeve of his frock
rolled up, and showing his name and
date of birth tattooed upon his arm.
It was a sight full of suggestions: <i>he
seemed his own head-stone</i>." We would
implore Mr Melville to beware of a
fault by no means uncommon with a
certain school of writers at the present
day, but into which it would be
unworthy a man of his ability to fall.
We refer to that straining for striking
similes, at the expense of truth and
good taste, of which he has here furnished
us with a glaring example. A
dead sailor's name is tattooed upon his
arm; <i>therefore</i>&mdash;mark the consequence&mdash;he
seems his own head-stone.
How totally inapt is this;
how violent and distorted the figure!
Such tricks of pen may, by a sort of
tinsel glitter, dazzle for a moment
superficial persons, who weigh not
what they read; but they will never
obtain favour, or enhance a reputation
with any for whose verdict Mr
Melville need care. Neither will he,
we apprehend, gain much praise, that
is worth having, for such exaggerated
exhibitions of the horrible as that
afforded in chapter VI. of his second
volume. Passing through Lancelott's
Hey, a narrow street of warehouses,
Redburn heard "a feeble wail, which
seemed to come out of the earth....
I advanced to an opening, which communicated
downwards with deep tiers
of cellars beneath a crumbling old
warehouse; and there, some fifteen
feet below the walk, crouching in
nameless squalor, with her head bowed
over, was the figure of what had been
a woman. Her blue arms folded to
her livid bosom two shrunken things
like children, that leaned towards her,
one on each side. At first I knew
not whether they were dead or alive.
They made no sign; they did not
move or stir; but from the vault came
that soul-sickening wail." We cannot
quite realise the "opening" in
question, but take it for granted to be
some sufficiently dreary den, and are
only puzzled to conjecture how, considering
its depth, the woman and
children got there. Redburn himself
seems at a loss to account for it. This,
however, his compassionate heart tarried
not to inquire; but, perceiving
the poor creatures were nearly dead
with want, he hurried to procure them
assistance. In an open space hard by,
some squalid old women, the wretched
<i>chiffoni&egrave;res</i> of the docks, were gathering
flakes of cotton in the dirt heaps.
To these Redburn appealed. They
knew of the beggar-woman and her
brats, who had been three days in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>
the pit or vault, with nothing to eat,
but they would not meddle in the matter;
and one hag, with an exaggerated
morality that does not sound
very probable, declared "Betsy Jennings
deserved it, for she had never
been married!" Turning into a more
frequented street, Redburn met a policeman.
"None of my business,
Jack," was the reply to his application.
"I don't belong to that street.
But what business is it of yours? Are
you not a Yankee?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I; "but come, I will
help you to remove that woman, if you
say so."</p>

<p>"There now, Jack, go on board
your ship, and stick to it, and leave
these matters to the town."</p>

<p>Two more policemen were applied
to with a like result. Appeals to the
porter at an adjacent warehouse, to
Handsome Mary the hostess, and
Brandy Nan the cook at the Sailors'
boarding-house, were equally fruitless.
Redburn took some bread and
cheese from his dinner-room, and carried
it to the sufferers, to whom he
gave water to drink in his hat&mdash;descending
with great difficulty into the
vault, which was like a well. The
two children ate, but the woman refused.
And then Redburn found a
dead infant amongst her rags, (he describes
its appearance with harrowing
minuteness,) and almost repented
having brought food to the survivors,
for it could but prolong their misery,
without hope of permanent relief. And
on reflection, "I felt an almost irresistible
impulse to do them the last
mercy, of in some way putting an end
to their horrible lives; and I should
almost have done so, I think, had I
not been deterred by thought of the
law. For I well knew that the law,
which would let them perish of themselves,
without giving them one sup
of water, would spend a thousand
pounds, if necessary, in convicting
him who should so much as offer
to relieve them from their miserable
existence." The whole chapter is in
this agreeable style, and indeed we
suppress the more revolting and exaggerated
passages. Two days longer,
Redburn informs us, the objects of his
compassion linger in their foul retreat,
and then the bread he throws to them
remains untasted. They are dead,
and a horrible stench arises from the
opening. The next time he passes,
the corpses have disappeared, and
quicklime strews the ground. Within
a few hours of their death the nuisance
has been detected and removed,
although for five days, according to
Redburn, they had been allowed to
die by inches, within a few yards of
frequented streets, and with the full
knowledge and acquiescence of sundry
policemen. We need hardly waste a
comment on the more than improbable,
on the utterly absurd character,
of this incident. It will be apparent
to all readers. Mr Melville is, of
course, at liberty to introduce fictitious
adventure into what professes
to be a narrative of real events; the
thing is done every day, and doubtless
he largely avails of the privilege. He
has also a clear right to deal in the
lugubrious, and even in the loathsome,
if he thinks an occasional dash of tragedy
will advantageously relieve the
humorous features of his book. But
here he is perverting truth, and leading
into error the simple persons who
put their faith in him. And, from the
consideration of such misguidance, we
naturally glide into the story of Master
Harry Bolton. Redburn had been
at Liverpool four weeks, and began to
suspect that was all he was likely to
see of the country, and that he must
return to New York without obtaining
the most distant glimpse of "the old
abbeys, and the York minsters, and
the lord mayors, and coronations, and
the maypoles and fox-hunters, and
Derby races, and dukes, and duchesses,
and Count d'Orsays," which his boyish
reading had given him the habit
of associating with England,&mdash;when
he one day made acquaintance, at the
sign of the Baltimore Clipper, with "a
handsome, accomplished, but unfortunate
youth, one of those small but
perfectly-formed beings who seem to
have been born in cocoons. His complexion
was a <i>mantling brunette</i>, feminine
as a girl's; his feet were small;
his hands were white; and his eyes
were large, black, and womanly; and,
poetry aside, his voice was as the
sound of a harp." It is natural to
wonder what this dainty gentleman
does in the sailors' quarter of Liverpool,
and how he comes to rub his
dandified costume against the tarry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
jackets of the Clippers' habitual frequenters.
On these points we are
presently enlightened. Harry Bolton
was born at Bury St Edmunds. At
a very early age he came into possession
of five thousand pounds, went
up to London, was at once admitted
into the most aristocratic circles,
gambled and dissipated his money in
a single winter, made two voyages to
the East Indies as midshipman in a
Company's ship, squandered his pay,
and was now about to seek his fortune
in the New World. On reaching
Liverpool, he took it into his head,
for the romance of the thing, to ship
as a sailor, and work his passage.
Hence his presence at the docks, and
his acquaintance with Redburn, who,
delighted with his new acquaintance,
prevails on him to offer his services to
Captain Riga of the Highlander, who
graciously accepts them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I now had a comrade in my afternoon
strolls and Sunday excursions; and
as Harry was a generous fellow, he shared
with me his purse and his heart. He
sold off several more of his fine vests and
trousers, his silver-keyed flute and enamelled
guitar; and a portion of the money
thus furnished was pleasantly spent
in refreshing ourselves at the roadside
inns, in the vicinity of the town. Reclining
side by side in some agreeable
nook, we exchanged our experiences of
the past. Harry enlarged upon the fascinations
of a London life; described the
curricle he used to drive in Hyde Park;
gave me the measurement of Madame
Vestris' ankle; alluded to his first introduction,
at a club, to the madcap Marquis
of Waterford; told over the sums he had
lost upon the turf on a Derby day; and
made various but enigmatical allusions
to a certain Lady Georgiana Theresa, the
noble daughter of an anonymous earl."</p></blockquote>

<p>Even Redburn, inexperienced as he
is in the ways of the old country, is
inclined to suspect his new friend of
"spending funds of reminiscences not
his own,"&mdash;that being as near an
approach as he can make to accusing
the he-brunette with the harp-like
voice of telling lies&mdash;until one day, when
passing a fashionable hotel, Harry
points out to him "a remarkable
elegant coat and pantaloons, standing
upright on the hotel steps, and containing
a young buck, tapping his
teeth with an ivory-headed riding-whip."
The buck is "very thin and
limber about the legs, with small feet
like a doll's, and a small, glossy head
like a seal's," and presently he steps
to "the open window of a flashing
carriage which drew up: and, throwing
himself into an interesting posture,
<i>with the sole of one boot vertically
exposed, so as to show the stamp on it&mdash;a
coronet</i>&mdash;fell into a sparkling conversation
with a magnificent white
satin hat, surmounted by a regal
marabout feather, inside." The young
gentleman with the seal's-head and
the coroneted-boot, is, as Harry assures
Redburn, whilst dragging him hastily
round a corner, Lord Lovely, a most
particular "old chum" of his own.
"Sailors," Redburn somewhere observes,
"only go <i>round</i> the world
without going <i>into</i> it; and their reminiscences
of travel are only a dim
recollection of a chain of tap-rooms
surrounding the globe, parallel with
the equator." This being the case,
we would have him abstain from
giving glimpses of the English aristocracy,
his knowledge of which seems
to be based upon the revelations of
Sunday newspapers, and upon that
class of novels usually supposed to
be written by discarded valets-de-chambre.
But we are not let off with
this peep at a truant fashionable. Mr
Bolton, having found a purse, or
picked a pocket, or in some way or
other replenished his exchequer, rigs
out Redburn in a decent suit of clothes,
and carries him off to London, previously
disguising himself with false
whiskers and mustaches. Enchanted
to visit the capital, Redburn does not
inquire too particularly concerning
these suspicious proceedings, but takes
all for granted, until he finds himself
"dropped down in the evening among
gas-lights, under a great roof in Euston
Square. London at last," he exclaims,
"and in the West End!" If not
quite in the West End, he is soon
transported thither by the agency of a
cab, and introduced by his friend into
a "semi-public place of opulent entertainment,"
such as certainly exists nowhere
(at least in London) but in our
sailor-author's lively imagination.
The number of this enchanted mansion
is forty, it is approached by high steps,
and has a purple light at the door.
Can any one help us with a conjecture?
The following passage we take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>
to be good of its kind: "The cabman
being paid, Harry, adjusting his
whiskers and mustaches, <i>and bidding
me assume a lounging look, pushed his
hat a little to one side</i>, and then, locking
arms, we sauntered into the house,
myself feeling not a little abashed&mdash;it
was so long since I had been in any
courtly society." A pair of tailors
strutting into a casino. It would
seem there are cockneys even in
America. The "courtly society" into
which the Yankee sailor boy and his
anomalous acquaintance now intrude
themselves is that of "knots of gentlemanly
men, seated at numerous
Moorish-looking tables, supported by
Caryatides of turbaned slaves, with
cut decanters and taper-waisted
glasses, journals, and cigars before
them." We regret we have not room
for the description of the magnificent
interior, which is a remarkable specimen
of fine writing; but we must
devote a word to the presiding genius
of the mysterious palace, were it only
for the sake of a simile indulged in by
Redburn. At the further end of the
brilliant apartment, "behind a rich
mahogany turret-like structure, was a
very handsome florid old man, with
snow-white hair and whiskers, and in
a snow-white jacket&mdash;<i>he looked like an
almond-tree in blossom</i>." Enshrined
in mahogany turrets, and adorned by
so imaginative a pen, who would suspect
this benign and blooming old
sinner of condescending to direct
waiters and receive silver. Nevertheless
these, we are told, are his
chief duties&mdash;in short, we are allowed
to suppose that he is the steward of
this club, hell, tavern, or whatever
else it is intended to be. Bolton
speaks a word to the almond tree, who
appears surprised, and they leave the
room together. Redburn remains over
a decanter of pale-yellow wine, and
catches unintelligible sentences, in
which the words <i>Loo</i> and <i>Rouge</i> occur.
Presently Bolton returns, his face
rather flushed, and drags away Redburn,
not, as the latter hoped, for a
ramble, "perhaps to Apsley House,
in the Park, to get a sly peep at the
old Duke before he retired for the
night," but up magnificent staircases,
through rosewood-doors and palatial
halls, of all which we have a most
florid, high-flown, and classical description.
Again Bolton leaves him,
after being very oracular and mysterious,
and giving him money for his
journey back to Liverpool, and a letter
which he is to leave at Bury, should
he (the aforesaid Bolton) not return
before morning. And thereupon he
departs with the almond-tree, and
Redburn is left to his meditations, and
hears dice rattle, has visions of frantic
men rushing along corridors, and
fancies he sees reptiles crawling over
the mirrors, and at last, what with
wine, excitement, and fatigue, he falls
asleep. He is roused by Harry
Bolton, very pale and desperate, who
draws a dirk, and nails his empty
purse to the table, and whistles
fiercely, and finally screams for
brandy. Now all this sort of thing,
we can assure its author, is in the
very stalest style of minor-theatre
melodrama. We perfectly remember
our intense gratification when witnessing,
at country fairs in our boyish
days, a thrilling domestic tragedy, in
which the murderer rushes on the
stage with a chalked face and a gory
carving-knife, howling for "Brandy!
Brandy!!" swallows a goblet of
strong toast and water, and is tranquillised.
But surely Mr Melville
had no need to recur to such antiquated
traditions. Nor had he any
need to introduce this fantastical
gambling episode, unless it were upon
the principle of the old cakes of roses
in the apothecary's shop&mdash;to make up a
show. We unhesitatingly qualify the
whole of this London expedition as
utter rubbish, intended evidently to
be very fine and effective, but which
totally misses the mark. Why will
not Mr Melville stick to the ship?
There he is at home. The worst
passages of his sea-going narrative
are better than the best of his metropolitan
experiences. In fact, the
introduction at all of the male brunette
is quite impertinent. Having got
him, Mr Melville finds it necessary to
do something with him, and he is
greatly puzzled what that is to be.
Bolton's character is full of inconsistencies.
Notwithstanding his two
voyages to the East Indies, and his
great notion of "the romance" of
working his passage as a common
sailor, when he comes to do duty on
board the Highlander he proves him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>self
totally ignorant of nautical matters,
and is so nerveless a mariner
that, on ascending a mast, he
nearly falls into the sea, and nothing
can induce him again to go aloft.
This entails upon him the contempt
and ill-treatment of his officers and
shipmates, and he leads a dog's life
between Liverpool and New York.
"Few landsmen can imagine the
depressing and self-humiliating effect
of finding one's self, for the first time,
at the beck of illiterate sea-tyrants,
with no opportunity of exhibiting any
trait about you but your ignorance of
everything connected with the sea-life
that you lead, and the duties you
are constantly called on to perform.
In such a sphere, and under such circumstances,
Isaac Newton and Lord
Bacon would be sea-clowns and
bumpkins, and Napoleon Buonaparte
be cuffed and kicked without remorse.
In more than one instance I have
seen the truth of this; and Harry,
poor Harry, proved no exception."
Poor Harry, nervous, effeminate, and
sensitive, was worried like a hare by
the rude sea-dogs amongst whom he
had so imprudently thrust himself.
His sole means of propitiating his
tormentors was by his voice, and
"many a night was he called upon to
sing for those who, through the day,
had insulted and derided him."
Amidst his many sufferings, Redburn
was his only comforter, and at times,
of an evening, they would creep under
the lee of the long-boat and talk of
the past, and still oftener of the
future; for Harry referred but unwillingly
to things gone by, and especially
would never explain any of the mysteries
of their London expedition, and
had bound Redburn by an oath not to
question him concerning it. He confessed,
however, that his resources
were at end; that besides a chest of
clothes&mdash;relics of former finery&mdash;he
had but a few shillings in the world;
and, although several years his senior,
he was glad to take counsel of the
sailor boy as to his future course
of life, and what he could do in
America to earn a living, for he was
determined never to return to England.
And when Redburn suggested
that his friend's musical
talents might possibly be turned to
account, Harry caught at the idea,
and volunteered the following curious
information:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In some places in England, he said,
it was customary for two or three young
men of highly respectable families, of
undoubted antiquity, but unfortunately
in lamentably decayed circumstances,
and threadbare coats&mdash;it was customary
for two or three young gentlemen, so
situated, to obtain their livelihood by
their voices; coining their silvery songs
into silvery shillings. They wandered
from door to door, and rang the bell&mdash;<i>Are
the ladies and gentlemen in?</i> Seeing
them at least gentlemanly-looking, if not
sumptuously apparelled, the servant
generally admitted them at once; and
when the people entered to greet them,
their spokesman would rise with a gentle
bow, and a smile, and say, <i>We come,
ladies and gentlemen, to sing you a song;
we are singers, at your service.</i> And so,
without waiting reply, forth they burst
into song; and, having most mellifluous
voices, enchanted and transported all
auditors; so much so, that at the conclusion
of the entertainment they very
seldom failed to be well recompensed,
and departed with an invitation to return
again, and make the occupants of that
dwelling once more delighted and happy."</p></blockquote>

<p>Should it not be added that these
errant minstrels of ancient family,
decayed circumstances, and courtly
manners, had their faces lamp-blacked,
and carried bones and banjos, and
sang songs in negro slang with gurgling
choruses? Some such professors
we have occasionally seen parading
the streets of English towns, although
we are not aware of their being customarily
welcomed in drawing-rooms.
We ask Mr Herman Melville to explain
to us his intention in this sort
of writing. Does it contain some
subtle satire, imperceptible to our
dull optics? Does he mean it to be
humorous? Or is he writing seriously?
(although that seems scarcely possible,)
and does he imagine he is
here recording a common English
custom? If this last be the case,
we strongly urge him immediately to
commence a work "On the Manners
and Customs of the British Isles."
We promise him a review, and guarantee
the book's success. But we
have not quite done with Harry
Bolton, and may as well finish him
off whilst our hand is in. Objections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>
being found to troubadourising in
New York, the notion of a clerkship
is started, Harry being a good penman;
and this brings on a discussion
about hands, and Redburn utterly
scouts the idea of slender fingers and
small feet being indicative of gentle
birth and far descent, because the
half-caste paupers in Lima are dainty-handed
and wee-footed, and moreover,
he adds, with crushing force of
argument, a fish has no feet at all!
But poor Harry's tender digits and
rosy nails have grievously suffered
from the pollution of tar-pots, and
the rough contact of ropes, and oftentimes
he bewails his hand's degradation,
and sighs for the palmy days
when it handed countesses to their
coaches, and pledged Lady Blessington,
and ratified a bond to Lord
Lovely, &amp;c. &amp;c. All which is abundantly
tedious and commonplace, and
will not bear dwelling upon.</p>

<p>Part of the Highlander's cargo on
home-voyage was five hundred emigrants,
to accommodate whom the
"between-decks" was fitted up with
bunks, rapidly constructed of coarse
planks, and having something the
appearance of dog-kennels. The
weather proved unfavourable, the
voyage long, the provisions of many
of the emigrants (who were chiefly
Irish) ran short, and the consequences
were disorder, suffering, and disease.
Once more upon his own ground, and
telling of things which he knows, and
has doubtless seen, Mr Melville again
rises in our estimation. His details
of emigrant life on board are good;
and so is his account of the sailors'
shifts for tobacco, which runs short,
and of Jackson's selfishness, and
singular ascendency over the crew.
And also, very graphic indeed, is the
picture of the steerage, when the
malignant epidemic breaks out, and
it becomes a lazar-house, frightful
with filth and fever, where the wild
ignorant Irishmen sat smoking tea
leaves on their chests, and rise in
furious revolt, to prevent the crew
from taking the necessary sanitary
measures of purification, until at
last favourable breezes came, and fair
mild days, and fever fled, and the
human stable (for it was no better)
was cleansed, and the Highlander
bowled cheerily onwards, over a pleasant
sea, towards the much-desired
haven. Two incidents of especial
prominence occur during the voyage&mdash;one
at its outset, the other near its
close. Whilst yet in the Prince's
Dock, three drunken sailors are
brought on board the Highlander by
the crimps. One of them, a Portuguese,
senseless from intoxication, is
lowered on deck by a rope and rolled
into his bunk, where the crimp tucks
him in, and desires he may not be
disturbed till out at sea. There he
lies, regardless of the mate's angry
calls, and seemingly sunk in a trance,
until an unpleasant odour in the forecastle
arouses attention, and Jackson
discovers that the man is dead. Yet
the other sailors doubt it, especially
when, upon Red Max holding a light
to his face, "the yellow flame wavered
for a moment at the seaman's motionless
mouth. But then, to the silent
horror of all, two threads of greenish
fire, like a forked tongue, darted out
from between the lips; and in a
moment the cadaverous face was
crawled over by a swarm of wormlike
flames. The lamp dropped from the
hand of Max, and went out, which
covered all over with spires and
sparkles of flame, that faintly crackled
in the silence; the uncovered parts of
the body burned before us, precisely
like a phosphorescent shark in a midnight
sea." Spirit-drinking, the seaman's
bane, had made an end of
Miguel the Portuguese. What shocked
Redburn particularly, was Jackson's
opinion "that the man had been
actually dead when brought on board
the ship; and that knowingly, and
merely for the sake of the month's
advance, paid into his hand upon the
strength of the bill he presented, the
body-snatching crimp had shipped a
corpse on board the Highlander."
The men trembled at the supernatural
aspect of the burning body, but reckless
Jackson, with a fierce jeer, bade
them hurl it overboard, which was
done. Jackson knew not how soon
the waves were to close over his own
corpse. Off Cape Cod, when the
smell of land was strong in the nostrils
of the weary emigrants, orders
were given, one dark night, in a stiff
breeze, to reef topsails; and Jackson,
who had been deadly ill and off duty
most part of the voyage, came upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
deck, to the surprise of many, to do
his duty with the rest, by way of
reminder, perhaps, to the captain, that
he was alive and expected his wages.
Having pointed pretty freely to Mr
Melville's defects, it is fair to give an
example of his happier manner.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"At no time could Jackson better
signalise his disposition to work, than
upon an occasion like the present; which
generally attracts every soul on deck,
from the captain to the child in the
steerage.</p>

<p>"His aspect was damp and deathlike;
the blue hollows of his eyes were like
vaults full of snakes, [another of Mr
Melville's outrageous similes]; and, issuing
so unexpectedly from his dark tomb in
the forecastle, he looked like a man
raised from the dead.</p>

<p>"Before the sailors had made fast the
reef-tackle, Jackson was tottering up the
rigging; thus getting the start of them,
and securing his place at the extreme
weather end of the topsail-yard&mdash;which
is accounted the post of honour. For it
was one of the characteristics of this man,
that, though when on duty he would shy
away from mere dull work in a calm,
yet in tempest time he always claimed
the van, and would yield it to none;
and this, perhaps, was one cause of his
unbounded dominion over the men.</p>

<p>"Soon we were all strung along the
main-topsail yard; the ship rearing and
plunging under us, like a runaway steed;
each man griping his reef-point, and
sideways leaning, dragging the sail over
towards Jackson, whose business it was
to confine the reef corner to the yard.</p>

<p>"His hat and shoes were off; and he
rode the yard-arm end, leaning backward
to the gale, and pulling at the
earing-rope like a bridle. At all times,
this is a moment of frantic exertion with
sailors, whose spirits seem then to partake
of the commotion of the elements,
as they hang in the gale, between heaven
and earth&mdash;and then it is, too, that they
are the most profane.</p>

<p>"'Haul out to windward!' coughed
Jackson with a blasphemous cry, and he
threw himself back with a violent strain
upon the bridle in his hand. But the
wild words were hardly out of his mouth
when his hands dropped to his side, and
the bellying sail was spattered with a
torrent of blood from his lungs.</p>

<p>"As the man next him stretched out
his arm to save, Jackson fell headlong
from the yard, and, with a long seethe,
plunged like a diver into the sea.</p>

<p>"It was when the ship had rolled to
windward; which, with the long projection
of the yard-arm over the side, made
him strike far out upon the water. His
fall was seen by the whole upward-gazing
crowd on deck, some of whom were
spotted with the blood that trickled from
the sail, while they raised a spontaneous
cry, so shrill and wild, that a blind man
might have known something deadly had
happened.</p>

<p>"Clutching our reef-points, we hung
over the stick, and gazed down to the
one white, bubbling spot, which had
closed over the head of our shipmate;
but the next minute it was brewed into
the common yeast of the waves, and Jackson
never arose. We waited a few
moments, expecting an order to descend,
haul back the foreyard, and man the
boat; but instead of that, the next
sound that greeted us was, 'Bear a
hand, and reef away, men!' from the
mate."</p></blockquote>

<p>If it be possible (we are aware that
it is very difficult) for an author to
form a correct estimate of his own
productions, it must surely have
struck Mr Melville, whilst glancing
over the proof-sheets of <i>Redburn</i>,
that plain, vigorous, unaffected writing
of this sort is a far superior style of thing
to rhapsodies about Italian boys and
hurdy-gurdies, to gairish descriptions
of imaginary gambling-houses, and
to sentimental effusions about Harry
Bolton, his "Bury blade," and his
"Zebra," as he called him&mdash;the latter
word being used, we suppose, to indicate
that the young man was only one remove
from a donkey. We can assure
Mr Melville he is most effective when
most simple and unpretending; and
if he will put away affectation and
curb the eccentricities of his fancy,
we see no reason for his not becoming
a very agreeable writer of nautical
fictions. He will never have the
power of a Cringle, or the sustained
humour and vivacity of a Marryat,
but he may do very well without
aspiring to rival the masters of the
art.</p>

<p><i>Redburn</i> is not a novel; it has no
plot; the mysterious visit to London
remains more or less an enigma to
the end. But having said so much
about Harry Bolton, the author deems
it expedient to add a tag touching
the fate of this worthy, whom Redburn
left in New York; in charge of a
friend, during his own temporary absence,
and who had disappeared on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
his return. For years he hears
nothing of him, but then falls in,
whilst on a whaling cruise in the Pacific,
with an English sailor, who tells
how a poor little fellow, a countryman
of his, a gentleman's son, and who
sang like a bird, had fallen over the
side of a Nantucket craft, and been
jammed between ship and whale.
And this is Harry Bolton. A most
lame and impotent conclusion, and
as improbable a one as could well
be devised, seeing that a sailor's life
was the very last the broken down
gambler was likely to choose, after
his experience of his utter incapacity
for it, and after the persecution and
torments he had endured from his
rude shipmates on board the Highlander.</p>

<p>When this review of his last work
meets the eye of Mr Herman Melville,
which probably it will do, we would
have him bear in mind that, if we
have now dwelt upon his failings, it is
in the hope of inducing him to amend
them; and that we have already,
on a former occasion, expended at
least as much time and space on a
laudation of his merits, and many undeniable
good qualities, as a writer.
It always gives us pleasure to speak
favourably of a book by an American
author, when we conscientiously can
do so. First, because Americans,
although cousins, are not <i>of the house</i>;
although allied by blood, they are in
some sort strangers; and it is an act
of more graceful courtesy to laud a
stranger than one of ourselves. Secondly,
because we hope thereby to
encourage Americans to the cultivation
of literature&mdash;to induce some to
write, who, having talent, have not
hitherto revealed it; and to stimulate
those who have already written to
increased exertion and better things.
For it were false modesty on our part
to ignore the fact, that the words of
Maga have much weight and many
readers throughout the whole length
and breadth of the Union&mdash;that her
verdict is respectfully heard, not only
in the city, but in the hamlet, and
even in those remote back-woods
where the law of Lynch prevails.
And, thirdly, we gladly praise an
American book because we praise
none but good books, and we desire
to see many such written in America,
in the hope that she will at last awake
to the advantages of an international
copyright. For surely it is little creditable
to a great country to see her
men of genius and talent, her Irvings
and Prescotts, and we will also say
her Coopers and Melvilles, publishing
their works in a foreign capital, as
the sole means of obtaining that fair
remuneration which, although it
should never be the sole object, is
yet the legitimate and honourable
reward of the labourer in literature's
paths.</p>

<p>If the experience of the last twelve
months has not opened the eyes of
the most inveterate of Mr Cobden's
quondam admirers to the real quality
of their idol, we very much fear that
such unhappy persons are beyond the
reach of the moral oculist. From the
first moment of his appearance upon
the political stage, while yet unbe-praised
by Peel, and unrewarded by
that splendid testimonial, accorded
unto him by judicious patriots, one
moiety of whom have since done
penance for their premature liberality
in the <i>Gazette</i>, we understood the true
capabilities of the man, and scrupled
not to say that a more conceited personage
never battered the front of a
hustings. Some excellent but decidedly
weak-minded people were rather
offended with the freedom of our
remarks upon the self-sufficient Cagliostro
of free trade, in whose powers
of transmutation they were disposed
to place implicit reliance and belief.
The Tamworth certificate, which we
shrewdly suspect its author would now
give a trifle to recall, was founded on as
evidence sufficient to condemn our obstinate
blindness and illiberality; for
who could doubt the soundness of an
opinion emanating from a statesman
who was just then depositing, in a
mahogany wheelbarrow, the first sod,
raised with a silver spade, on a railway
which, when completed, was to
prove a perfect California to the shareholders?
It is not impossible that,
at this moment, some of the shareholders
may be on their way to the
actual California&mdash;having found,
through bitter experience, that some
kinds of diggings are anything but productive,
and having learned that elderly
orators, who make a practice of studying
the gyrations of the weather-cock,
may be sometimes mistaken in their
calculations. Matters fared worse
with us, when it was bruited through
the trumpet of fame, that, in every
considerable capital of Europe, multitudes
had assembled to do homage to
the apostle of the new era. Our compassionate
friends, possibly deeming
us irretrievably committed to folly,
put on mourning for our transgression,
and ceased to combat with our
adversaries, who classed us with the
worst of unbelievers. One facetious
gentleman proposed that we should
be exhibited in a glass-case, as a
specimen of an extinct animal; another,
indulging in a more daring
flight of fancy, stigmatised us as a
cankerworm, gnawing at the root of
the tree of liberty. We fairly confess
that we were pained at the alienation
of friends whom we had previously
considered as staunch as the steel of
Toledo: as for our foemen, we, being
used to that kind of warfare, treated
them with consummate indifference.
Yet not the less, on that account, did
we diligently peruse the journals,
which, from various lands, winged
their way to the table of our study,
each announcing, in varied speech,
that Richard Cobden was expatiating
upon the blessings of free-trade and
unlimited calico to the nations. These
we had not studied long, ere we discovered
that, upon one or two unfortunate
points, there was a want of
understanding between the parties
who thus fraternised. The foreign
audiences knew nothing whatever
about the principles which the orator
propounded; and the orator knew, if
possible, still less of the languages in
which the compliments of the audiences
were conveyed. In so far as
any interchange of ideas was concerned,
Mr Cobden might as well
have been dining on cold roast monkey
with the King of Congo and his
court, as with the bearded patriots
who entertained him in Italy and
Spain. His talk about reciprocity
was about as distinct to their comprehension,
as would have been his
definition of the differential calculus;
nevertheless their shoutings fell no
whit less gratefully on the ear of the
Manchester manufacturer, who interpreted
the same according to his own
sweet will, and sent home bragging
bulletins to his backers, descriptive of
the thirst for commercial interchange
which raged throughout Europe, and
of the pacific tendencies of the age.
Need we remind our readers of what
followed? Never had unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
prophet been possessed by a more
lying and delusive demon. The
words were hardly out of his mouth,
before the thunderstorm of revolution
broke in all its fury upon France,
and rolled in devastating wrath over
every kingdom of the Continent.
Amongst the foremost agents in this
unholy work were the friends and
entertainers of Mr Cobden, for whose
tranquil dispositions he had been foolish
enough to volunteer a pledge.
How he must have cursed "my
friend Cremieux," when he found
that unscrupulous gentleman giving
the lie to all his asseverations! No
man, unless cased in a threefold
covering of brass, could have held up
his head to the public, after so thorough
and instantaneous an exposure
of his miserable fallacies. But our
Richard is not to be easily put down.
No one understands the trade of the
agitator better; for, when baffled,
put to silence, and covered with ridicule
on one topic, he straightway
shifts his ground, and is heard declaiming
on another. It is his misfortune
that he has been compelled to
do this rather frequently, for in no
one single instance have events realised
his predictions. Free trade,
which was to make every man rich,
has plunged the nation in misery.
Reciprocity, for all practical purposes,
is an obsolete word in the dictionary.
The Continental apostles of commercial
exchange have been amusing
themselves by cutting each others'
throats, and hatching villanous
schemes for the subversion of all
government; nor has one of them a
maravedi left, to expend in the purchase
of calico. The colonies are up
in arms against the policy of the
mother country. Undismayed by
these failures, still the undaunted
Cobden lifts up his oracular voice,
advocating in turn the extension of
the suffrage, the abolition of standing
armies, financial reform, and what
not. It matters not to him that, on
each new attempt, the rotten tub on
which he takes his stand is either
kicked from under his feet, or goes
crashing down beneath the weight of
the husky orator&mdash;up he starts from
the mire like a new Ant&aelig;us, and,
without stopping to wipe away the
unsavoury stains from his visage, holds
forth upon a different text, the
paragon of pertinacious preachers. We
could almost find it in our hearts to be
sorry that such singular pluck should
go without its adequate reward. But
a patriot of this stamp is sure to become
a nuisance. However numerous
his audience may be at first, they are
apt to decline when the folly of the
harangue is made patent to the meanest
capacity, and when current events
everlastingly combine to expose the
nature of the imposture. The popularity
of Cobden, for some time back,
has been terribly on the wane. Few
and far between are his present political
ovations; and even men of his
own class begin to consider him a
humbug. We are given to understand
that, in a majority of the commercial
rooms, the first glass of the
statutory pint of wine is no longer
graced with an aspiration for his prosperity
and length of years; and some
ungrateful recreants of the road now
hint, that to his baleful influence may
be attributed the woful diminution of
orders. That exceedingly mangy
establishment, ycleped the Free-trade
Club, of which he was the father and
founder, has just given up the ghost;
and great is the joy of the denizens of
St James's Square at being relieved
from the visitations of the crew that
haunted its ungarnished halls. Ordinary
men might be disheartened by a
succession of such reverses&mdash;not so
Cobden. Like an ancient Roman, he
gathers his calico around him, and
announces to a gratified world that he
is ready to measure inches with the
Autocrat of all the Russias!</p>

<p>Cobden is fond of this kind of feat.
About a year ago he put out the same
challenge to the Duke of Wellington
and the Horse Guards, just as we find
it announced in the columns of <i>Bell's
Life in London</i>, that Charles Onions
of Birmingham is ready to pitch into
the Champion of England for five
pounds aside, and that his money is
deposited at the bar of the Pig and
Whistles. But even as the said champion
does not reply to the defiance of
the full-flavoured Charles, so silent
was He of the hundred fights when
Richard summoned him to the field.
Failing this meditated encounter, our
pugnacious manufacturer next despatches
a cartel to Nicholas, and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span>
response having arrived from St
Petersburg, he magnanimously professes
himself ready to serve out the
house of Hapsburg! Really there is
no setting bounds to the valour or the
ambition of this vaunting Achilles,
who, far stronger than his prototype,
or even than the fabled Hercules,
states that he can crumple up kingdoms
in his hand as easily as a sheet
of foolscap. We stand absolutely appalled
at the temerity of unappeasable
Pelides.</p>

<p>Our readers are probably aware
that, for some time past, there has
been an attempt to preach up a sort of
seedy Crusade, having for its ostensible
object the universal pacification
of mankind. With such an aim no
good man or sincere Christian can
quarrel. Peace and good-will are expressly
inculcated by the Gospel, and
even upon lower grounds than these
we are all predisposed in their favour.
So that, when America sent us a new
Peter the Hermit, in the shape of one
Elihu Burritt, heretofore a hammerer
of iron, people were at a loss to comprehend
what sort of a mission that
could be, which, without any fresh
revelation, was to put the matter in a
clearer light than was ever exhibited
before. We care not to acknowledge
that we were of the number of those
who classed the said Elihu with the
gang of itinerant lecturers, who turn
a questionable penny by holding forth
to ignorant audiences upon subjects
utterly beyond their own contracted
comprehension. Nor have we seen
any reason to alter our opinion since;
for the accession of any amount of
noodles, be they English, French,
Dutch, Flemish, or Chinese, can in
no way give importance to a movement
which is simply and radically
absurd. If the doctrines and precepts
of Christianity cannot establish peace,
cheek aggression, suppress insubordination,
or hasten the coming of the
millennium, we may be excused for
doubting, surely, the power of Peace
Congresses, even when presided over
by so saintly a personage as Victor
Hugo, to accomplish those desirable
ends. We do not know whether Alexander
Dumas has as yet given in his
adhesion. If not, it is a pity, for his
presence would decidedly give additional
interest to the meetings.</p>

<p>Even on the score of originality, the
founders of the Peace Associations
cannot claim any merit. The idea
was long ago struck out, and promulgated,
by that very respectable sect
the Quakers; and though in modern
times some of that fraternity, John
Bright for example, have shown
themselves more addicted to wrangling
than befits the lamb-like docility of
their profession, we believe that opposition
to warfare is still their leading
tenet. We can see no reason, therefore,
why the bread should be so unceremoniously
taken from the mouth
of Obadiah. If the ingenious author
of <i>Lucretia Borgia</i> and <i>Hans of Iceland</i>
wishes to become the leader of a
great pacific movement, he ought, in
common justice, to adopt the uniform
of the existing corps. He certainly
should treat the promenaders
of the Boulevards to a glimpse of
the broad-brimmed hat and sober
drab terminations, and conform to
the phraseology as well as the habiliments
of the followers of William
Penn.</p>

<p>It may be questionable whether, if
the experiment of free trade had succeeded,
Elihu would have obtained
the countenance of so potent an auxiliary
as Cobden. Our powers of
arithmetic are too limited to enable
us, at this moment, to recall the precise
amount of additional annual
wealth which the member for the West
Riding, and the wiseacres of <i>The Economist</i>,
confidently predicted as the
necessary gain to the nation; it was
something, the bare mention of which
was enough to cause a Pactolus to
distil from the chops of a Chancellor
of the Exchequer, especially if he belonged
to the Whig persuasion, and
was, therefore, unaccustomed to the
miracle of a bursting revenue. But
as no such miracle ensued; and as, on
the contrary, Sir Charles Wood was
put to his wit's end&mdash;no very formidable
stretch&mdash;to diminish a horrible
deficit by the sale of rope-ends, rusty
metal, and other material which was
classed under the head of government
stores, it was clearly high time for our
nimble Cobden to shift his ground.
Accordingly he fell foul of the army,
which he would fain have insisted on
disbanding; and this move, of course,
brought him within the range of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
orbit already occupied by the eccentric
Elihu.</p>

<p>It is not very easy to attain to a
distinct understanding of the means
which the Peace Association proposed
to adopt, for carrying out this benevolent
scheme. Most of the gentlemen
who have already figured at their debates
are so excessively muddleheaded,
that it seems impossible to
extract from their speeches the vestige
of a distinct idea. This much, however,
after diligent study, we have gathered,
that it is proposed to substitute arbitration
in place of war, and to render
that mode of arrangement almost necessary
by a general European disarmament.
Nothing could tally better
with the views of Cobden. A higher
principle than that of mere retrenchment
is thus brought to bear upon his
darling scheme of wiping off the army
and the navy; and we must needs
confess that, to a considerable proportion
of the population of modern
Europe, the scheme must be extremely
palatable.</p>

<p>Standing armies, we are told, are
of no earthly use in the time of peace,
and their expense is obviously undeniable.
If peace could be made universal
and perpetual, there would be
an end of standing armies. The best
means for securing perpetual peace is
to do away with standing armies,
because without standing armies there
would be no facilities for war. This
is the sort of argument which we are
now asked to accept; but, unfortunately,
we demur both to the premises and
the conclusion. Indeed, in a matter
of this kind, we utterly repudiate the
aid of logic, even were it a great deal
more scientifically employed. That
of the free-traders is, if possible, worse
than their arithmetic, though, a year
or two ago, they were ready to have
staked their existence on the infallibility
of the latter.</p>

<p>The experience of the last eighteen
months has given us all some tangible
proof of the advantages of standing
armies. Setting aside the Denmark
affair, and also the occupation of Rome,
there has been one aggressive war
waged in Europe by sovereign against
sovereign. That war, we need hardly
say, was commenced by Charles Albert
of Sardinia, who, basely and perfidiously
availing himself of the intestine
difficulties of Austria, attempted to
seize the opportunity of making himself
master of Lombardy. We need
not recapitulate the history of that
campaign, so glorious to the veteran
Radetsky, and so shameful to his unprincipled
opponent: but it is well
worth remarking, that the whole of
the sympathies of Mr Cobden and his
radical confederates are enlisted on
the side of the Italian insurgents; and
that, with all their professed horror
for war, we never hear them attribute
the slightest blame to the Sardinians
for having marched in hostile array
across the frontier of a friendly power.
Nor is this all. In every case where
the torch of insurrection has been
lighted, we find the advocates of peace
clamorous in their approbation of the
movement. Without knowledge, without
judgment, without anything like
due consideration either of the provocation
given on the one side, or the
license claimed on the other, they have
invariably lent their voices to swell
the revolutionary cry, and backed the
drunken populace in their howl against
order and government. Whoever was
loyal and true has been branded
as a ruffian and a murderer. Assassination,
when it proceeded from the
mob, was in their eyes no offence at
all. Some of them, employing terms
which we never thought to have heard
an Englishman utter, have rather
chuckled over the spectacle of nobles,
priests, and statesmen stabbed, shot
down, hewn with axes, or torn limb
from limb by savages, whose atrocity
was not equalled by that of the worst
actors in the early French Revolution,&mdash;and
have not been ashamed to vindicate
the authors of such hideous outrage.</p>

<p>Aggressive war we deprecate, to
say the least of it, as strongly as any
peace orator who ever spouted from a
platform; but we by no means think
that peace, in the catholic sense of
the word, can be at all endangered by
the maintenance of standing armies.
So far as the military establishment
of Great Britain is concerned, we have
already had occasion, in a former
paper, to show that it is barely sufficient
for the occupation of our large
and numerous colonies, and greatly
inferior in proportion to that of any
other country in Europe. We cer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>tainly
do not intend to resume that
discussion, because the sense of the
nation has unequivocally condemned
the pragmatic fools who provoked it;
and even the Whigs, who coquetted
with them, have seen the folly of their
ways, and are not likely, in a hurry,
to attempt any numerical reduction.
But we go a great deal farther.
We maintain, that without the assistance
of the standing armies throughout
Europe during the late critical
juncture, anarchy would now have
been triumphant, and civilisation
have received a check so terrible, that
ages might have elapsed before we
could have recovered from its effects.
Revolution is incalculably a greater
disaster than war; and the higher the
point of civilisation to which a nation
has attained before it permits the democratic
flame, smothering beneath
the surface of all society, to burst out
into fury, the more dangerous and
difficult to extinguish must be the
conflagration. But for the regular
army of France, red republicanism
would now be triumphant, and a new
Reign of Terror have begun. The
armies and discipline of Prussia alone
preserved the Rhenish provinces and
the Palatinate from anarchy, plunder,
and devastation; and, failing those of
Austria, Vienna would have been a
heap of ashes. Ultra-democrats, in all
ages, have exclaimed against standing
armies as instruments of tyranny for
suppressing and overawing the people,
and they have argued that such a force
is incompatible with free institutions.
Such declamation is perfectly natural,
both now and heretofore, when we
reflect who the individuals are that
use it. No class of persons are more
bitter against the police than the
professional thieves. To them the
constable's baton also is an emblem
of intolerable tyranny, because it interferes
with those liberal ideas regarding
the distribution of property
which have been philosophically expounded
and reduced to ethics by
certain sages of the socialist school.
The democrat hates the soldier, because
he considers him an obstacle in the
way of that political regeneration
which is merely another word for the
institution of a reign of terror.</p>

<p>We do not, however, think it necessary
to enter into any elaborate exposition
of the idleness of the peace movement.
So long as the gentlemen who
have gratuitously constituted themselves
a congress exhibit so much common
sense as to retain the semblance
of consistency, we should hardly feel
ourselves called upon to interfere in
any way with their arrangements.
We should be the last people in the
world to grudge to Mr Ewart, or any
other senator of such limited calibre,
the little notoriety which he may
chance to pick up by figuring in Paris
as a champion of pacific fraternity.
The paths towards the Temple of
Fame are many and devious; and if a
man feels himself utterly wanting in
that intellectual strength which is necessary
for attaining the summit by
the legitimate and beaten road, he is
certainly entitled to clamber up to any
odd pinnacle from which he can make
himself, for a moment, the object of
observation. In minor theatres, it is
not uncommon to find a broken-down
tragedian attempting to achieve some
popularity in a humble line, by jumping
as Harlequin through a clock, or
distorting his ochre-coated visage by
grinning magnanimously as the clown.
To such feats no fair exception can be
taken; and we doubt not that a roar
of laughter, proceeding from the throats
of the most ignorant assemblage of
numskulls, is as grateful to the ears of
the performer as would be the applause
of the most enlightened and fastidious
audience. We believe that, in the
case of the Congress, audience and
orators were extremely well suited to
the capacity of each other. The people
of Paris, who drank in the rolling
periods of the pacificators, were exceedingly
amused with the exhibition;
and testified their delight, by greeting
the reproduction of the farce, in
the shape of a Vaudeville at the
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s, with unextinguishable
shouts of laughter!</p>

<p>Neither shall we make any comment
upon the singularity of the time selected
for these demonstrations. The
members of the Congress expressly set
forth, that it was their desire to impress
upon the governments of Europe the
folly of maintaining large establishments,
and we presume that they entertained
some reasonable hope that
their remonstrances might at least be
heard. We need scarcely point out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>
our readers the eminent fitness of the
present juncture for carrying these
views into effect. We have great
faith in the extent and power of human
idiocy, but we hardly supposed that
any body of men could have been congregated,
possessed of so much collective
imbecility as to conceive that
this was a proper moment for securing
the conviction, or enlisting the sympathies
of any government in their
scheme. We are, however, forced to
conclude, that a good many of them
are sincere; and, believing this, our
regard for their honesty rises in a corresponding
ratio with the decline of
our respect for the measure of their
intellects. It would probably be unjust
and wrong to confound some of
these simple souls with men of the
stamp of their new ally, who use their
association merely as a means for the
promulgation of part of their political
opinions, but who, in reality, are so
far from being the friends of peace,
that they seem bent upon using their
utmost efforts to involve the whole of
Europe in a new and desolating war.
While, therefore, we drop for the present
any further notice of the proceedings
of the Peace Congress, we feel it
our imperative duty to trace the steps
of Mr Cobden since, arrayed in sheep's
clothing, he chose to make his appearance
in the midst of that innocent
assembly.</p>

<p>Whatever sympathy may have been
shown in certain quarters towards the
Italian insurgents, that feeling has
been materially lessened by the awful
spectacles afforded by insurgent rule.
We are, in this country, a great deal
too apt to be carried into extravagance
by our abstract regard for constitutional
freedom. We forget that our
own system has been the gradual
work of ages; that the enlightenment
and education of the people has invariably
preceded every measure of substantial
reform; and that it is quite
possible that other nations may not be
fitted to receive like institutions, or to
work out the social problem, without
more than British restraint. Arbitrary
government, being quite foreign
to our own notions, is invariably regarded
by us with dislike; and our
decided impulse, on the appearance of
each new insurrection, is to attribute
the whole of the blame to the inflexibility
of the sovereign power. So
long as this feeling is merely confined
to expression of opinion at home, it is
comparatively, though not altogether,
harmless. Undue weight is attached
abroad to the articles of the press,
enunciated with perfect freedom, but
certainly not always expressing the
sense of the community; and foreign
statesmen, unable to appreciate this
license, have ere now taken umbrage
at diatribes, which, could the matter
be investigated, would be found to
proceed from exceedingly humble
sources. So long, however, as our
government professed and acted upon
the principles of non-interference,
there was little likelihood of our being
embroiled in disputes with which we
had no concern, simply on account
of liberal meetings, tavern speeches,
or hebdomadal objurgations of despotism.</p>

<p>The real danger commenced when
a government, calling itself liberal,
began to interfere, most unjustifiably
and most unwisely, with the concerns
of its neighbours. Powerless to do
good at home, the Whigs have ever
shown themselves most ready to do
mischief abroad; and probably, in
the whole history of British diplomacy,
there stands recorded no transaction
more deplorable, from first to
last, than the part which Lord Palmerston
has taken in the late Italian
movements. It is the fashion to laud the
present Foreign Secretary as a man of
consummate ability; nor is it possible
to deny that, so far as speech-making
is concerned, he certainly surpasses his
colleagues. We were almost inclined
to go farther, and admit that no one
could equal him in dexterity of reading
official documents, so as to mystify
and distort their meaning; but
were we to assign him pre-eminence
in this department, we should do signal
injustice to Earl Grey, who unquestionably
stands unrivalled in the
art of coopering a despatch. Ability
Lord Palmerston certainly has, but
we deny that he has shown it in his
late Italian negotiations. Restless
activity is not a proof of diplomatic
talent, any more than an appetite for
intrigue, or a perverse obstinacy of
purpose. Men of the above temperament
have, in all ages, been held incompetent
for the duties of so delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>
and difficult a station as that of minister
of foreign affairs; and yet who
will deny that the whole course of our
recent diplomatic relations with the
south of Europe, has been marked by
an unusual display of restlessness, obstinacy,
and intrigue? Public men
must submit to have their labours
judged of by their fruits; it is the penalty
attached to their high office, and
most righteously so, since the destinies
of nations are committed to their
hands. Lord Palmerston may possibly
have thought that, by dictating
to the governments of Italy the nature
of the relations which, in his
opinion, ought to subsist between
them and their subjects, he was consulting
the honour and advantage
of England, fulfilling his duty to the
utmost, and providing for the maintenance
of the public tranquillity of
Europe. We say it is possible that such
was his thought and intention; but, if
so, surely never yet did a man, possessing
more than common ability, resort
to such extraordinary means, or employ
such incapable agents. Of all the men
who could have been selected for such
a service, Lord Minto was incalculably
the worst. We have nothing
whatever to say against that nobleman
in his private capacity; but,
throughout his whole public, we cannot
say useful, career, he has never,
on one occasion, exhibited a spark
even of ordinary talent, and it is more
than questioned by many, whether his
intelligence rises to the ordinary level.
Through accident and connexion he
has been thrust into state employment,
and has never rendered himself
otherwise remarkable than for a most
egregious partiality for those of his
family, kindred, and name. And yet
this was the accredited agent sent
out by Lord Palmerston to expound
the intentions and views of Great
Britain, not only to the sovereigns of
Italy, but also to their revolted subjects.</p>

<p>We say nothing of the diplomatic
employment of such a representative
as Mr Abercromby, at the court of
Turin. The correspondence contained
in the Blue Books laid before parliament,
shows how singularly ignorant
that minister was of the real posture of
affairs in Italy; how eagerly he caught
at every insinuation which was thrown
out against the good faith and pacific
policy of Austria; and how completely
he was made the tool and the
dupe of the revolutionary party. It
is enough to note the fruits of the Palmerstonian
policy, which have been,
so far as we are concerned, the utter
annihilation of all respect for the British
name in Italy, insurrections, wild
and wasting civil war, and, finally,
the occupation of Rome by the French.
Whatever may be thought of the prudence
of this latter move, or whatever
may be its remote consequences, this
at least is certain, that, but for Oudinot
and his army, the Eternal City
would have been given up as a prey
to the vilest congregation of ruffians
that ever profaned the name of liberty
by inscribing it on their blood-stained
banners. To associate the cause of
such men with that of legitimate freedom
is an utter perversion of terms;
and those who have been rash enough
to do so must stand convicted, before
the world, of complete ignorance of their
subject. No pen, we believe, could
adequately describe the atrocities
which were perpetrated in Rome, from
the day when Count Rossi fell by the
poniard of the assassin, on the steps
of the Quirinal palace, down to that
on which the gates were opened for the
admittance of the besieging army.
Not the least of Popish miracles was
the escape of Pius himself, who beheld
his secretary slain, and his bodyguard
butchered by his side. Of these
things modern liberalism takes little
note: it hears not the blood of innocent
and unoffending priests cry out
for vengeance from the pavement; it
makes no account of pillage and spoliation,
of ransacked convent, or of
harried home. It proclaims its sympathy
aloud with the robber and the
bravo, and is not ashamed to throw
the veil of patriotism over the enormities
of the brigand Garibaldi!</p>

<p>When, therefore, not only a considerable
portion of the press of this
country, but the government itself, is
found espousing the cause of revolution
in the south of Europe, we need
not be surprised if other governments,
at a period of so much danger and
insecurity, regard Great Britain as a
renegade to the cause of order. Our
position at present is, in reality, one
of great difficulty, and such as ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
to make us extremely cautious of
indulging in unnecessary bravado.
The state of our financial affairs is
anything but encouraging. We are
answerable for a larger debt than any
other nation of the world; and our
economists are so sensible of the
weight of our burdens, that they
would fain persuade us to denude ourselves
even of the ordinary means of
defence. Our foreign exports are
stationary; our imports immensely
increasing; our home market reduced,
for the present, to a state of terrible
prostration. Free trade, by destroying
the value of agricultural produce,
has almost extinguished our last hope
of restoring tranquillity to Ireland, and
of raising that unhappy country to the
level of the sister kingdoms. It is in
vain that we have crippled ourselves
to stay the recurring famine of years,
since our statesmen are leagued with
famine, and resolute to persevere in
their iniquity. The old hatred of
the Celt to the Saxon is still burning
in the bosoms of a large proportion
of the misguided population of
Ireland; and were any opportunity
afforded, it would break forth as violently
as ever. So that, even within
the girdle of the four seas, we are not
exactly in that situation which might
justify our provoking unnecessary
hostility from abroad. So far we are
entirely at one with the Peace Congress.
When we look to the state of
our colonies, the prospect is not more
encouraging. Through Whig misrule,
our tenure of the Canadas has become
exceedingly precarious. The West
Indies are writhing in ruin; and even
the inhabitants of the Cape are rampant,
from the duplicity of the Colonial
Office. Our interest is most
clearly and obviously identified with
the cause of order; for, were Britain
once actively engaged in a general
war, it is possible that the presence
of her forces would be required in
more than a single point. Of the
final result, in the event of such a
calamity, we have no doubt, but not
the less, on that account, should we
deeply deplore the struggle.</p>

<p>Such being our sentiments, it is
with considerable pain that we feel
ourselves called upon to notice as
strong an instance of charlatanism
and presumption as was ever exhibited
in this country. Fortunately,
on this occasion, the offender has
gone so far that no one can be
blind to his delinquencies; for, if there
be any truth in the abstract principles
of the Peace Association, their last
disciple has disowned them; if the
doctrines of free trade were intended
to have universal application, Richard
Cobden, in the face of the universe,
has entered his protest against them.
It signifies very little to us, and less
to the powers against whom he has
thundered his anathemas, what Mr
Cobden thinks proper either to profess
or repudiate; still, as he has been
pleased to attempt the performance of
the part of Guy Fawkes, we judge it
necessary to conduct him from the coal-cellar,
and to throw the light of the
lantern upon his visage, and that of
his accomplices. And, first, a word
or two as to the occasion of his last
appearance.</p>

<p>The recent Hungarian rising is by
no means to be classed in the same
category with the wretched Italian
insurrections. Much as it is to be
deplored that any misunderstanding
should have arisen between the Austrian
cabinet and the Hungarian Diet,
so serious as to have occasioned a
war; we look upon the latter body as
uninfluenced by those wild democratic
notions which have been and are
still prevalent in the west of Europe.
Whatever may have been the case
with Kossuth, and some of his more
ambitious confederates, the mass of the
Hungarian people had no wish whatever
to rise in rebellion against their
king. Their quarrel was that of a minor
state to which certain privileges had
been guaranteed; against the presumed
infringement of which, by their more
powerful neighbour, they first protested,
and finally had recourse to
arms. Their avowed object, throughout
the earlier part of the struggle, was
not to overturn, but to maintain, certain
existing institutions: and it is
remarkable that, from the day on which
Kossuth threw off the mask, and renounced
allegiance to his sovereign,
the Hungarians lost confidence in
their leader, and their former energy
decayed. We need not now discuss
the abstract justice of the Hungarian
claims; but whatever may be thought
of these, we must, in common fairness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>
to Austria, consider her peculiar position
at the time when they were
sought to be enforced. Concessions
which, during a season of tranquillity,
might have been gracefully made, were
rendered almost impossible when demanded
with threats, in the midst of
insurrection and revolt. It was but
too obvious that the leaders of the
Hungarian movement, forgetful of their
fealty to the chief of that great empire
of which their country formed a part,
were bent upon increasing instead of
lessening the difficulties with which
Austria was everywhere surrounded,
and eager to avail themselves of distractions
elsewhere, for the purpose of
dictating insolent and exorbitant
terms. In short, we believe that the
real claims of Hungary, however they
may have formed the foundation of
the discontent which ripened into war,
were used by Kossuth and his colleagues
as instruments for their own
ambition; and that, by throwing off
the mask too precipitately, they
opened the eyes of their followers to
the true nature of their designs, and
forfeited that support which the realm
was ready to accord the men who,
with a single and patriotic purpose,
demanded nothing more than the
recognition of the rights of their
country.</p>

<p>It was but natural that the intervention
of Russia should have been
viewed with some uneasiness in the
west of Europe. Every movement of
that colossal power beyond the boundaries
of its own territory excites a
feeling of jealousy, singularly disproportionate
to the real character of its
resources, if Mr Cobden's estimate of
these should be adopted as the true
one; and we fairly confess that we
have no desire to see any considerable
augmentation made to the territorial
possessions of the Czar. But the assistance
which, on this occasion, has
been sent to Austria by Russia, however
much we may regret the occasion
which called the latter into activity,
cannot surely be tortured into any
aggressive design. Apart from all
our jealousies, it was a magnanimous
movement on the part of one powerful
sovereign in favour of a harassed
ally; nor can we see how that assistance
could have been refused by
Russia, without incurring the reproach
of bad faith, and running imminent
risk with regard to her own dependencies.
Those active revolutionists, the
Poles, whose presence behind every
barricade has been conspicuously
marked and unblushingly avowed,
showed themselves foremost in all the
disturbances which threatened the
dismemberment of Austria. By them
the Hungarian army was principally
officered; and it now appears, from the
intercepted correspondence of their
nominal chief, that the Hungarian insurrection
was relied upon as the first
step for a fresh attempt towards the
restoration of a Polish kingdom.
Under these circumstances, the Czar
felt himself imperatively called upon
to act; and his honour has been amply
vindicated by the withdrawal of his
forces after his mission was accomplished,
and the Hungarian insurrection
quelled.</p>

<p>It would undoubtedly have been
far more satisfactory to every one, if
the differences between Austria and
Hungary could have been settled
without an appeal to arms; but such
a settlement was, we apprehend,
utterly beyond the powers even of the
Peace Congress to effect; and the
next best thing is to know that tranquillity
has actually been restored.
That a great deal of sympathy should
be shown for the Hungarians, is, under
the circumstances, by no means
unnatural. It is no exaggeration to
say, that hardly one man out of a
thousand, in Britain, comprehends the
merits of the dispute, or is able, if
called upon, to give an intelligible account
of the quarrel. Such amount
of knowledge, however, is by no
means necessary to qualify a platform
orator for holding forth at a moment's
notice; and, accordingly, meetings
expressive of sympathy with the persecuted
Hungarians were called in
many of our larger towns, and the
usual amount of rhodomontade uttered,
by gentlemen who make a point of
exhibiting their elocutionary powers
upon the slightest colourable pretence.
Had these meetings been held earlier,
they might have been worth something.
We shall not go the length of
assuring the very shallow and conceited
personages who constitute the
oratorical rump, or public debating
society of Edinburgh, that their opi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>nions
are likely to be esteemed of surpassing
importance, even if they were
to be heard of so far as St Petersburg
or Vienna; for their utter ignorance
of the aspect of foreign affairs is such
as would excite ridicule in the bosoms
of those whom they profess to patronise
and applaud. But if they really
were impressed with the notion that
the claims of Hungary were of such
mighty importance, how was it that
they tarried until the consideration of
all constitutional questions had been
swallowed up in war&mdash;until those who
fully understood the true position of
Hungary, and her rights as legally
guaranteed and defined, were forced
to acknowledge that, through the
violence, treachery, and ambition of
the insurgent nobles, all hope of a
pacific settlement had disappeared;
and that the best result which Europe
could hope for, was the speedy
quenching of an insurrection, now
broadly revolutionary and republican,
and threatening to spread still wider
the devastating flames of anarchy?
The explanation we believe to be a
very simple one. Most of them knew
as much of the affairs of Cappadocia
as they did of those of Hungary, and
they would have been equally ready
to spout in favour of either country.</p>

<p>Late in July, Mr Bernal Osborne,
backed by Mr R. M. Milnes, whose
knowledge of politics is about equal
to his skill in the construction of dactyls,
brought forward the Hungarian
question in the House of Commons,
and thereby gave Lord Palmerston an
opportunity of unbosoming himself on
that branch of our European relations.
His lordship's speech, on that occasion,
was very much lauded at the time;
but on referring to it now, we are
somewhat at a loss to understand how
it could have given satisfaction to any
one. It was, indeed, as insulting to
Austria, whose back was then supposed
to be at the wall, as any opponent of
constitutional government could have
desired. Alliance was sneered at, as a
mere empty word of no significance
whatever: nor can we much wonder
at this ebullition, considering the
manner in which his lordship has
thought proper to deal with other
powers, who attached some value to
the term. This topic was, further, a
congenial one, inasmuch as it afforded
the Foreign Secretary an opportunity
of gibing at his predecessor, Lord
Aberdeen, whose sense of honour does
not permit him to identify the solemn
treaties of nations with folios of waste
paper; and who, therefore, was held
up to ridicule as a pattern of "antiquated
imbecility." But, after all
this persiflage, which could serve no
purpose whatever, save that of giving
vent to an unusual secretion of Palmerstonian
bile, it appeared that his
lordship was actually to do nothing
at all. He regretted, just as much as
we do, and probably not more than
the Austrian cabinet, that no accommodation
of differences had taken
place. He said, very truly, that
whatever the result of the struggle
might be, it could not strengthen the
stability of the Austrian empire; but
at the same time he distinctly repudiated
all intention of interfering beyond
mere passive advice, and he
could not deny the right of Austria, if
it thought proper, to call in the aid of
the Russian arms. His conclusion,
in short, was sound, and we only regret
that, while it was so, the tone
and temper of his speech were not
equally judicious. This debate in the
House of Commons was immediately
followed up by a public meeting at the
London Tavern, presided over by Mr
Alderman Salomons.</p>

<p>We had not the good fortune to be
present on that occasion; but, from the
accounts contained in the morning
papers, it must have been an assemblage
of a singularly motley kind.
There was a considerable muster of
Radical members of parliament; the
Financial Reform and the Peace Associations
were respectively represented;
Lord Nugent and Mr Milnes
stood forth as delegates from the
Bards of Britain; Julian Harney and
Mr G. W. M. Reynolds headed a
numerous band of Chartists; and Lord
Dudley Stuart, as a matter of course,
was surrounded by a whiskered phalanx
of Poles, Hungarians, Italians,
Germans, and Sicilians, each one
striving to look more patriotically
ferocious than his neighbour. The first
sympathetic resolution was moved by
a Quaker, and seconded by no less a
person than Richard Cobden, who
had only been prevented from attending
the previous debate in the House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>
of Commons by a swan-hopping expedition
on the Thames.</p>

<p>Then it was that Mr Cobden first
favoured the world with some economical
views, so exceedingly novel and
startling, as to excite, even in that
audience, unequivocal symptoms of
incredulity. He set out by laying it
down as a general rule, that every
separate state ought to be left to the
management of its own affairs, without
the interference of any foreign
power whatever. "If," said he, "this
had been a question simply between
Hungary and Austria, I should not
have appeared here to-day, nor indeed
would it have been necessary for
any of us to have appeared here to-day.
So long as the Hungarians were
left to settle their affairs with the
government of Vienna, they were perfectly
competent to do it, without the
interference of the citizens of London."
This is intelligible enough.
So long as central governments are
merely fighting with their own dependencies,
there is no room at all, according
to Mr Cobden, for interference.
It matters not which side prevails:
they must be left wholly to
themselves. This doctrine could not,
we think, have been very acceptable
to the Poles; since it amounts to an
entire admission that Russia has a
right to deal with them at her pleasure;
neither is it altogether consistent
with our ideas, or interpretation
of the law of nations. But it is Cobden's
view, and therefore let it pass,
to him, then, it mattered nothing
whether Goth or Hun prevailed&mdash;it
was the intervention of Russia that
peremptorily called him to the platform.
Now we must own, that we
cannot understand this sort of reasoning,
though it may possibly be suited
to the capacities of a Manchester
audience. If, as many people no
doubt conscientiously believe, Austria
was trampling upon the liberties of a
brave and loyal people, not only
justice, but humanity demands that
our sympathies should be enlisted on
their side. We cannot acquiesce in a
doctrine which would have left the
Greeks (lamentably small sense as
they have shown of the benefits of
liberty) to toil on for ever under the
grievous yoke of the Ottoman: nor
are we prepared to carry our apathy
to so extreme a length. The intervention
of Russia could not, by
any possibility, alter the complexion
of the quarrel. It might either crush
freedom, or maintain constitutional
government and the balance of power
in Europe; but the principle of the
contest, whatever that might be, was
declared before Russia appeared, and
according as men view it, so should their
sympathies be given. The whole question,
however, as Mr Cobden put the
case, turned upon Russian interference.</p>

<p>If Mr Cobden's next door neighbour
happened to have a dispute with
his operatives, touching the interpretation
of certain points of the Charter,
and if the latter, in their zeal for enlightenment,
were to set fire to their
master's premises, we apprehend that
the honourable member for the West
Riding, (having neglected his own
insurance,) might blamelessly bear a
hand to quench the threatening conflagration.
Further, if he were
assured that the said operatives,
assisted by a gang of deserters from
his own mills, were trying their hands
at an incendiary experiment, preliminary
to operating upon his calico
warehouses, how could he be blamed,
if he sallied to attack the rioters in
their first position? Yet, if we are
permitted to compare very great
things with small, this was precisely
the situation of Russia. If she did
not assist Austria, the flame would
have been kindled in her own provinces;
if the Hungarian insurrection
had triumphed, Poland would have
been up in arms. With the old partition
of Poland we have nothing now
to do, any more than with the junction
of the Slavonic provinces with Austria.
Right or wrong, these have long
become acknowledged facts in European
history, and the boundary divisions
have been acquiesced in by a
congress of the assembled nations.
We cannot go back upon matters of
ancient right and occupation; were
we to do so, the peace of every nation
in Europe must necessarily be disturbed,
and no alternative would remain,
save the Utopian one of parcelling
out territory according to the
language of the inhabitants. Boundaries
must be settled somehow.
They were so settled, by the consent
of all the nations, at the treaty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span>
Vienna; and our duty, as well as our
interest, is to adhere to that arrangement.
Russia, by assisting Austria,
has in no way contravened any of the
stipulations of that treaty. From the
moment when the Hungarian party declared
their country independent, and
proclaimed a republic, a new cause of
discord and misrule was opened in
the east of Europe, and the greatest
of the eastern potentates was not only
entitled but forced to interfere. It by
no means follows that we, who uphold
this view, have any partiality or liking
for Russian institutions. No man
who lives in a free country, like ours,
can possibly sympathise with despotism,
serfism, and that enormous
stretch of feudal power which is given
to a privileged class&mdash;we must regard
such things with a feeling nearly
akin to abhorrence; nor can we, with
our Saxon notions, fancy existence
even tolerable in such a state of
society. But our likings or disgusts
cannot alter matters as they stand.
We cannot force other nations to see
with our eyes, to think with our
thoughts, or to adapt their constitutions
according to the measure of our
accredited standard of excellence.
That amount of irresponsible and
uncontrolled action which we term
freedom, presupposes the existence of
a large and general spread of intelligence
throughout the community,
fixed laws of property, consolidated
social relationship, pure administration
of justice, and wisdom and
temperance on the part of the
governed and the governor. Such
things are not the rapid results of
months, or years, or centuries. They
are of slow growth, but they are the
inevitable fruits of order; and very
blind and ignorant must that man be
who does not see the hand of progress
at work even in the institutions of
Russia. That country emerged from
barbarism later than the rest of
Europe, but, since the days of Peter
the Czar, its strides towards civilisation
have been most rapid. Commerce
has been established, manufactures
introduced, learning and the
arts cultivated, and such a foundation
laid as, in no very long time, must
perforce secure to all ranks of the
people a larger share of freedom than
they are now qualified to enjoy.
Revolution cannot hasten such a
state of matters, but it may materially
retard it. Foolish and short-sighted
men seem to think that revolt is a
synonymous term with freedom, and,
accordingly, they hail each fresh outbreak
with shouts of indiscriminate
approval. They can draw no distinction
between the revolt of the
barons and that of Jack Cade in
England; they are as ready to applaud
Spartacus as Brutus; they think a
peasant's war as meritorious as the
up-raising of the standard of the
League. They never stop to consider
that freedom is a mere relative term,
and that it is worse than useless to
pluck down one form of government
by violence, unless a better is to be
reared in its stead. And who can
venture to say that this would have
been the case with Hungary? Who
would predict it with certainty even
of Poland, were that dismembered
kingdom to be restored? It is notorious
that Poland went to pieces
under the weight of its elective monarchy,
and the perpetual feuds, turbulence,
and tyranny of a lawless and
fierce aristocracy. No doubt, men
will fight for these things&mdash;they will
fight for traditions, and bad ones too,
as keenly as for the most substantial
benefits. A century ago, the Highlanders
would have fought to the
death for clanship, chieftainship,
heritable jurisdictions, and the right
of foray and of feud; but will any
man now raise up his voice in favour
of the old patriarchal constitution?
In Ireland, at this moment, we believe
that a large body of the Celts is willing
to stand up for a restoration of
the days of Malachi of the Golden
Collar&mdash;a form of government which,
we presume, even an O'Connell would
decline. This is just the case with
our sympathisers. They take it for
granted that, because there is revolt,
there must be a struggle for freedom,
and they are perfectly ready to accept,
without the slightest examination,
any legend that may be coined for
the nonce. Gullible as a considerable
number of the British public may be,
especially that section of the public
which delights in platform oratory,
we really could not have believed that
any assemblage could be so utterly
ignorant, as to receive a statement to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg 593]</a></span>
the effect that the old constitution of
Hungary bore a close resemblance to
our own!</p>

<p>We are tempted here to insert an
extract from the works of a popular
writer regarding the constitution of
Poland, because it expresses, in excellent
language, the opinions which
we are attempting to set forth in this
article, and denounces the folly of
those who confound the term freedom
with its just and rational application.
Will the reader favour us by perusing
the following passage with attention?&mdash;when
he has done so, we shall state
from whose eloquent pen it proceeded.</p>

<p>"Of how trifling consequence it
must be to the practical minded and
humane people of Great Britain, or to
the world at large, whether Poland be
governed by a king of this dynasty or
of that&mdash;whether he be lineally descended
from Boleslas the Great, or of
the line of the Jagellons&mdash;contrasted
with the importance of the inquiries
as to the social and political condition
of its people&mdash;whether they be as well
or worse governed, clothed, fed, and
lodged in the present day as compared
with any former period,&mdash;whether the
mass of the people be elevated in the
scale of moral and religious beings,&mdash;whether
the country enjoys a smaller
or a larger amount of the blessings of
peace; or whether the laws for the protection
of life and property are more or
less justly administered. These are the
all-important inquiries about which
we busy ourselves; and it is to cheat
us of our stores of philanthropy, by
an appeal to the sympathy with which
we regard these vital interests of a
whole people, that the declaimers and
writers upon the subject invariably
appeal to us on behalf of the oppressed
and enslaved <i>Polish nation</i>&mdash;carefully
obscuring, amidst the cloud of epithets
about 'ancient freedom,'
'national independence,' 'glorious
republic,' and the like, the fact that,
previously to the dismemberment, the
term <i>nation</i> implied only the nobles;&mdash;that,
down to the partition of their
territory, about nineteen out of every
twenty of the inhabitants were slaves,
possessing no rights, civil or political;
that about one in every twenty was a
nobleman&mdash;and that that body of
nobles formed the very worst aristocracy
of ancient or modern times;
putting up and pulling down their
kings at pleasure; passing selfish laws,
which gave them the power of life and
death over their serfs, whom they
sold and bought like dogs or horses;
usurping, to each of themselves, the
privileges of a petty sovereign, and
denying to all besides the meanest
rights of human beings; and, scorning
all pursuits as degrading, except that
of the sword, they engaged in incessant
wars with neighbouring states,
or plunged their own country into all
the horrors of anarchy, for the purpose
of giving employment to themselves
and their dependants." And
the same writer, after remarking upon
the character and conduct of the privileged
class in Poland, in language
which is just as applicable to those
of the Hungarian nobles, thus accounts
for the insurrection in 1830.
The Italics are his own. "<i>We hesitate
not emphatically to assert, that it
was wholly, and solely, and exclusively,
at the instigation, and for the selfish
benefit, of this aristocratic faction of
the people, that the Polish nation
suffered for twelve months the horrors
of civil war, was thrown back in her
career of improvement, and has since
had to endure the rigours of a conqueror's
vengeance.</i> The Russian
government was aware of this; and
its severity has since been chiefly
directed towards the nobility." And
in a note appended to the above paragraph
he says, "The peasants joined,
to a considerable extent, the standard
of revolt; but this was to be expected,
in consequence of the influence
necessarily exercised over them by the
superior classes. Besides, patriotism
or nationality is an instinctive virtue,
that sometimes burns the brightest in
the rudest and least reasoning minds;
and its manifestation bears no proportion
to the value of the possessions
defended, or the object to be gained.
The Russian serfs at Borodino, the
Turkish slaves at Ismail, and the lazzaroni
of Naples, fought for their masters
and oppressors more obstinately
than the free citizens of Paris or
Washington did, at a subsequent
period, in defence of those capitals."</p>

<p>And who was the author of these
very lucid and really excellent remarks?
We reply, <span class="smcap">Richard Cobden,
Esq.</span> The curious in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg 594]</a></span>
matters will find these, and many
similar passages, in a pamphlet entitled
<i>Russia, by a Manchester Manufacturer</i>,
which was published in 1836,
for the purpose of showing that, on
the whole, it would be an advantage
to British commerce if Russia were
to lay violent hands on Turkey, and
possess herself of Constantinople!</p>

<p>But it is time we should return to
the London Tavern meeting, where
we left Mr Cobden, this time denouncing
the active interference of Russia.
Here the apostle of peace was certainly
upon ticklish ground. Large
as his estimate undoubtedly is of his
own influence and power, he could
hardly expect, that, because he and
some other gentlemen of inferior endowments
were pleased to hold a
meeting in the London Tavern, and
pass resolutions condemnatory of the
conduct of the Czar, the immediate
consequence would be a withdrawal
of the Russian forces. Under such
circumstances, as he must have perfectly
well known, the expression of
his opinion was not worth the splinter
of a rush to the Hungarians, unless,
indeed, he were prepared to follow up
his words by deeds. On the other
hand, he was debarred, by some fifty
public declarations, from advocating
the propriety of a war: not only
upon the general pacific principle&mdash;for
that might easily have been evaded,&mdash;but
upon economical considerations
connected with his darling scheme of
reducing the British navy and army,
which would be clearly incompatible
with the commencement of a general
European conflict. An ordinary man,
entertaining such views and sentiments,
would probably have considered
himself as lodged between the
horns of an inextricable dilemma.
Not so Cobden, whose genius rose to
the difficulty. The experience of a
hundred platform fights had taught
him this great truth, that no proposition
was too monstrous to be crammed
down the public throat, provided the
operator possessed the requisite share
of effrontery; and he straightway proceeded,
<i>secundum artem</i>, to exhibit a
masterpiece of his skill.</p>

<p>Probably not one man in all that
room but had been impressed, from
his youth upwards, with a wholesome
terror and respect for the magnitude
of the Russian power. That, at all
events, was the feeling of the Poles,
and decidedly of the Polish champions.
But in less than an instant
they were disabused. Most of our
readers must have seen how a small
figure, painted on a tiny slip of glass,
may, when passed through the aperture
of a magic lantern, be made to
reflect the attitude and dimensions of
a giant: Cobden's trick was exactly
the opposite of this; he made the
actual giant appear in the dwindled
proportions of a dwarf. "I will tell
you," said he, "how we can bring
moral force to bear on these armed
despots. We can stop the supplies.
(Loud cheers.) Why, Russia can't
carry on two campaigns beyond her
own frontiers, without coming to
Western Europe for a loan. She
never has done so, without being
either subsidised by England, or borrowing
money from Amsterdam. I
tell you I have paid a visit there, and
I assert that they cannot carry on
two campaigns in Hungary, without
either borrowing money in Western
Europe or robbing the bank at St
Petersburg. (A laugh, and a cry of
'Question.') That must be a Russian
agent, a spy, for this is the question.
I know," continued our magniloquent
Richard, "that the Russian party,
here and abroad, would rather that I
should send against them a squadron
of cavalry and a battery of cannon,
than that I should fire off the facts
that I am about to tell you. I say,
then, that Russia cannot carry on two
campaigns without a loan." We
believe that the latter part of Mr
Cobden's statement is tolerably accurate,
so that he need not give himself
any further trouble about the production
of his indicated horse and artillery.
We agree with him that Russia
might be puzzled to carry on two
vigorous campaigns without a loan;
but we should be glad to know what
country in Europe is not in the same
predicament? War, as everybody
knows, is a very costly matter&mdash;not
much cheaper than revolution, though
a good deal more speedy in its results&mdash;and
every nation which engages in
it must, perforce, liquidate the expense.
Great Britain could not, any
more than Russia, go to war without
a loan. In such an event, the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg 595]</a></span>
difference would be that the British
loan must necessarily be six or seven
times greater than that of Russia, for
this simple reason, that Russia has a
large standing army levied and prepared,
whereas we have not. Now
what is there to prevent Russia from
negotiating a loan? The first question,
we apprehend, is the state of her
finances&mdash;let us see whether there is
any symptom of approaching bankruptcy
in these. The debt of Russia,
according to the most recent authorities,
is seventy-six millions, being as
near as possible one tenth of our own.
Her revenue is about seventeen millions,
or one-third of ours. So far,
therefore, as the mere elements of
credit go, Russia would, in the eyes of
the capitalist, be the more eligible
debtor of the two. There could, we
apprehend, be no possible doubt of
her solvency, for, with large resources
behind, she has a mere fraction of a
debt, and her power of raising revenue
by taxes has been little exercised.
Our readers will better understand
this by keeping in mind, that, while
the revenue presently levied is just
one-third of ours, the population of
Russia is considerably more than
double that of Great Britain and Ireland.
Mr Cobden, however, accepting,
as we presume he must do, the
above official facts, draws from them
inferences of a very startling character.
"Don't let any one talk," said
he, "of Russian resources. It is the
poorest and most beggarly country
in Europe. It has not a farthing.
Last year there was an immense deficit
in its income as compared with
its expenditure, and during the present
financial year it will be far worse.
Russia a strong political power!
Why, there is not so gigantic a political
imposture in all Europe." And
again, "Russia a strong, a powerful,
and a rich country! Don't believe
any one who tells you so in future.
Refer them to me." We feel deeply
obliged to Mr Cobden for the last
suggestion, but we would rather, with
his permission, refer to facts. If the
poorest and most beggarly country in
Europe has contrived to rear its magnificent
metropolis from the marshes
of the gelid Neva, to create and maintain
large and well-equipped fleets in
the Baltic and the Black seas, and to
keep up a standing army of about
half a million of men, without increasing
its permanent debt beyond the
amount already specified, all we shall
say is, that the semi-civilised Russian
is in possession of an economical
secret utterly unknown to the statesmen
of more favoured climes, and
that the single farthing in his hand,
has produced results more wonderful
than any achieved by the potency of
the lamp of Aladdin. But the climax
has yet to come. Waxing bolder and
bolder on the strength of each successive
assertion of Russian weakness
and impotency, the Apostle of Peace
assumed the attitude of defiance: "If
Russia should take a step that required
England, or any other great
maritime power, like the United
States, to attack that power, why, we
should fall like a thunderbolt upon
her. You would in six months crumple
that empire up, or drive it into its
own dreary fastnesses, as I now
crumple up that piece of paper in my
hand!!!" Here is a pretty fellow
for you! This invincible fire-eater
is the same man who, for the last
couple of years, has been agitating
for the reduction of the army and
navy, on the ground that the whole
world was in a state of the profoundest
peace, and likely so to remain!
This crumpler-up and defier of empires
is the gentleman who held forth
this bygone summer, at Paris, on the
wickedness of war, and on the spread
of fraternity and brotherly love among
the nations! Why, if old Admiral
Drake had risen from the dead, he
could not have spoken in a more warlike
strain, only the temper and tone
of his remarks would have been different.
A hero is bold but temperate: a
demagogue blustering and pot-valiant.</p>

<p>It is but right to say, that this
impudent and mischievous trash,
though of course abundantly cheered
by many of the poor creatures who
knew no better, did not altogether
impose upon the meeting. Mr Bernal
Osborne could not find it in his conscience
to acquiesce, even tacitly, in
this monstrous attempt at imposition,
and accordingly, though "he coincided
in much that had been said by the
member for the West Riding, he
must take the liberty to say that, in
exposing the weakness of Russia, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg 596]</a></span>
had gone rather too far. Forewarned
was forearmed, and let them not lay
it to their hearts that the great empire
was not to be feared, but despised."
And therefore, he, Mr Osborne,
"would be sorry if any man in the
meeting should go away with the
impression that the monstrous Pansclavonic
empire was to be thoroughly
despised." Neither did the chairman
exactly approve of the line of discussion
which had been introduced by
Mr Cobden. He said, with great
truth, that they had nothing to do at
present with the resources of Russia;
their business being simply to consider
the wrongs of Hungary, and to give
utterance to such an expression of
opinion as might act upon the British
government. Mr Salomons is a practical
man, and understands the use of
mob-meetings, which is to coerce and
compel Whig administrations to do
precisely what the frequenters of the
London Tavern desire. Better versed,
by a great deal, in monetary matters
than Mr Cobden, he knows that financial
discussions are utterly out of place
in such an assemblage; and, moreover,
we have a strong suspicion that the
latter part of Mr Cobden's speech, to
which we are just about to refer, must
have sounded harshly in the ears of a
gentleman of the Hebrew persuasion,
initiated, after the custom of his tribe,
in the mysteries of borrowing and
lending. Up to this point we have
considered Mr Cobden in the united
character of peace-maker and bully:
let us now see how he contrives to
combine the hitherto antagonistic qualities
of free-trader and restrictionist.</p>

<p>Having, satisfactorily to himself,
demonstrated the pitiable weakness of
Russia, and having got over the
notorious fact of her large bullion
deposit, and her purchases in the
British funds, by explaining that the
first is the foundation of her currency,
and the second a private operation of
the Bank of St Petersburg&mdash;an establishment
which, according to his
showing, is no way connected with
the government&mdash;Mr Cobden proceeded
to unravel his schemes for paring
the claws of the northern Bear. It
has the merit of pure simplicity. Not
one penny is henceforward to be lent
to the Russian government. The
capitalists of Europe are henceforth to
look, not to the security, but to the
motives of the borrowing power. If
they think that the money required
is to be expended in purchasing munitions
of war, in fitting out an
armament, or in any other way
hostile to the continuance of peace,
they are grimly to close their coffers,
shake their heads, and refuse
to advance one single sixpence,
whatever be the amount of percentage
offered; and this kind of moral
force, Mr Cobden thinks, would not
only be effectual, but can easily
be brought into action. Let us hear
him. "Now, will any one in the
city of London dare to be a party to
a loan to Russia, either directly or
openly, or by agency and copartnership
with any house in Amsterdam or
Paris? Will any one dare, I say, to
come before the citizens of this free
country, and avow that he has lent
his money for the purpose of cutting
the throats of the innocent people of
Hungary? I have heard such a project
talked of. But let it only assume
a shape, and I promise you that we,
the peace party, will have such a
meeting as has not yet been held in
London, for the purpose of denouncing
the blood-stained project&mdash;for the
purpose of pointing the finger of scorn
at the house, or the individuals, who
would employ their money in such a
manner&mdash;for the purpose of fixing
an indelible stigma of infamy upon the
men who would lend their money for
such a vile, unchristian, and barbarous
purpose. That is my moral force.
As for Austria, no one, I suppose,
would ever think of lending her
money." We shall, by-and-by, have
occasion to see more of Mr Cobden in
connexion with the Austrian loan; in
the mean time, let us keep to the general
proposition. The meaning of the
above unadorned fustian is simply
this&mdash;that no man shall, in future, presume
to lend his money without consulting
the views of Mr Cobden and
his respectable confederates. This
ukase&mdash;and a magnificent one it is&mdash;was
rapturously received by his audience;
a fiat of approval which we
set no great store on, seeing that, in all
probability, not fifty of those excellent
philanthropists could command
as many pounds for the permanent
purpose of investment. But the idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[Pg 597]</a></span>
of controlling, by their sweet voices,
the monetary operations of the great
banking-houses of the world, the
Rothschilds, the Barings, and the
Hopes, was too delicious a hallucination
not to be rewarded with a corresponding
cheer. Now, setting aside
the absolute impudence of the proposal&mdash;for
we presume Mr Cobden
must have known that he had as much
power to stay the flux of the tides, as
to regulate the actions of the money-lenders&mdash;what
are we to think of the
new principle enunciated by the veteran
free-trader? What becomes
of the grand doctrine of buying in
the cheapest and selling in the dearest
market, without the slightest regard
to any other earthly consideration,
save that of price? Will Mr Cobden
NOW venture to persuade us that he
had some mental reservation, when
he propounded that ever-memorable
axiom; or that dealers in coin were
to be regulated by a different code of
moral laws from that which was laid
down for the use of the more fortunate
dealers in calico? We presume, that,
without cotton, and blankets, and machinery
exported from this country,
the slaves of Cuba could hardly be
made to work&mdash;why, then, should we
not clap an embargo on these articles,
and point with the finger of scorn,
disgust, and execration, to every man
who traffics in that unholy trade?
And yet, if our memory serves us
right, no very long time has elapsed
since we beggared our West Indian
colonies, solely to drive a larger trade
in those articles with the slave plantations,
for behoof of Messrs Cobden
and Co. Slavery, we presume, is an
institution not congenial to the mind
of Mr Cobden&mdash;at least we hope not,
and we are sure he would not be willing
to admit it. In point of humanity,
it is rather worse than war; why not,
then, let us have a strong exercise of
moral force to abolish it, by stopping
the supplies? The withdrawal of our
custom, for three or four years, would effectually
knock Cuba on the head. Why
not try it? We should like to see Mr
Cobden's face, if such a proposition
were made in Parliament; and yet is
it not as rational, and a great deal
more feasible, than the other? But it
is a positive waste of time to dwell
further upon such a glaring absurdity
as this. Baron Rothschild, member-elect
though he be for the city of
London, will care very little for the
extended digit of Mr Cobden, and
will doubtless consult his own interest,
without troubling himself about Manchester
demagogues, when the next
Russian loan is proposed.</p>

<p>Having delivered himself of this
remarkable oration, Mr Cobden very
wisely withdrew; perhaps he had a
slight suspicion of the scene which
was presently to follow. The majority
of the meeting consisted of gentlemen
whose notions about moral force were
exceedingly vague and general. Their
strong British instincts, inflamed by
the stimulus of beer, led them to
question the use of abstract sympathy,
unless it was to be followed up by
action; and accordingly Mr Reynolds,
a person of some literary as well as
political notoriety, thought it his duty
to give a more practical turn to the
deliberations of the meeting, and
thereby cut short several interesting
harangues. We quote from the report
of the <i>Times</i> of 24th July.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr G. W. M. <span class="smcap">Reynolds</span>, whose remarks
were frequently followed by interruption
and cries of 'question,' next
addressed the meeting. He avowed his
belief, that in so holy, sacred, and solemn
a cause, England must even go to war in
defence of Hungary, if necessary. (This
assertion was received with such hearty
cheering as proved that the speaker had
expressed the sentiments of the vast body
of the meeting.) All the moral effects of
that meeting (continued Mr Reynolds)
would be perfectly useless, unless they
were prepared to go further. If the
government would employ some of the
ships that were now rotting in our harbours,
and some of the troops now marching
about London, that would really
benefit the Hungarians. (Cheers.) France
used to be regarded as a barrier against
Russia, but France was no longer so,
because that humbug Louis Napoleon
(tremendous cheers&mdash;and three hearty
groans for Louis Napoleon)&mdash;that rank
impostor (continued cheering)&mdash;</p>

<p>"The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span> here interfered, and
much interruption ensued. If anything
could disturb and injure the cause which
they were met to support, it was such
remarks as they had just heard. ("No,
no.") If he (the Chairman) were a spy
of Russia, he should follow out the course
pursued by Mr Reynolds. (Much confusion
and disapprobation.)"</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg 598]</a></span></p>

<p>We really cannot see wherein the
author of the <i>Mysteries of London</i> was
to blame. His proposition had, at all
events, the merit of being intelligible,
which Mr Cobden's was not, and he
clearly spoke the sentiments of the
large majority of the unwashed. He
certainly went a little out of his way,
to denounce the President of the
French Republic as an impostor: a
deviation which we regret the more, as
he might have found ample scope for
such expositions without going further
than the speeches of the gentlemen
who immediately preceded him. We
need not linger over the ensuing
scene. Mr Duncan&mdash;"said to be a
Chartist poet"&mdash;attempted to address
the meeting, but seems to have failed.
We do not remember to have met
with any of Mr Duncan's lyrics, but
we have a distinct impression of having
seen a gentleman of his name, and
imputed principles, at the bar of the
High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh.
But if the sacred voice of one
poet was not listened to, the same
meed of inattention was bestowed
upon another. The arms of Mr R.
M. Milnes were seen hopelessly gesticulating
above the press; and Lord
Dudley Stuart, for once, was cut
short in his stereotyped harangue.
The case was perfectly clear: Reynolds
was the only man who had
enunciated a practical idea, and accordingly
the voice of the meeting
was unequivocally declared for war.</p>

<p>We hope that the Peace Congress,
and the economists, and the free-traders,
are all equally delighted with
this notable exhibition of their hero.
If they are so, we certainly have no
further commentary to offer. To secure
peace, Mr Cobden openly defies
and challenges Russia; to further
economy, he does his best to inflame
the passions of the people, and to get
up a cry for war; to vindicate free
trade, he proposes henceforward to
coerce Lombard Street. Is there, in
all the history of imposture, an instance
comparable to this? Possibly
there may be; but, if so, we are certain
it was better veiled.</p>

<p>The evil luck of Mr Cobden still
clung to him. Within a very short
time after this memorable meeting
was held, the Hungarian armies
surrendered at discretion, and the insurrection
was thoroughly quenched.
Not two, not even one complete campaign,
were necessary to put an end to
an ill-advised struggle, in which the
hearts of the Hungarian people were
never sincerely enlisted; and good
men hoped that the sword might now
be sheathed in the eastern territories
of Europe. That portion of the press
which had sympathised with the insurgents,
and hailed with frantic delight
the suicidal resolution of the
Hungarian chiefs to separate themselves
for ever from the house of
Austria, was terribly mortified at a
result so speedy and unexpected; and
did its best to keep up the excitement
at home, by multiplying special instances
of cruelty and barbarity said
to have been wrought by the victors
on the persons of their vanquished
foemen. That many such instances
really occurred we do not for a
moment doubt. When the passions
of men have been inflamed by civil
war, and whetted by a desire for vengeance,
it is always difficult for the
authorities to preserve a proper restraint.
This is the case even among
civilised nations; and when we reflect
that a large portion of the troops on
either side engaged in the Hungarian
war, cannot with any justice be termed
civilised, it is no wonder if deeds of
wanton atrocity should occur. Indeed,
late events may lead us to question
how far civilisation, on such occasions,
can ever operate as a check. Who
could have believed that last year, in
Frankfort, a young and gallant nobleman,
whose sole offence was, the free
expressions of his opinions in a parliament
convened by universal suffrage,
should have been put to death
at noonday by lingering torments,
and his groans of agony echoed back
by the laughter of his brutal assassins?
The names of Felix Lichnowsky and
Von Auerswaldt will surely long be
remembered to the infamy of that
city which was the birthplace of
Goethe, and boasted of itself as the
refined capital of the Rhenish provinces.
A veil of mystery still hangs
over the circumstances connected with
the assassination of Count Latour; and
though we are unwilling to give currency
to a rumour, which would entail
infamy on the memory of one who
has since passed to his account, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span>
victim of an unbridled ambition,
strong suspicions exist that a Hungarian
minister was directly privy to
that act of dastardly and cruel murder.
But there is no manner of
doubt at all as to the atrocities which
were committed in Vienna when that
hapless city was in the hands of the
red republicans and the Poles. Pillage,
murder, and violation were crimes
of every-day occurrence, and it is not
wonderful if the memory of these
wrongs has in some instances goaded
on the victors to a revenge which all
must deplore. As to the military
executions which have taken place,
we have a word to say. The suppression
of almost every revolt has
been followed by strong measures on
the part of the conquerors, against
those who excited the insurrection.
Our own history is full of them.
Succeeding generations, according to
their estimate of the justness of the
cause which they espoused, have
blamed, or pitied, or applauded the
conduct of the men who thus perilled
and lost their lives; but the necessity
of such executions has rarely or never
been questioned. We allude, of
course, to those who have been the
leaders and instigators of the movement,
and upon whom the responsibility,
and the expiation for the
blood which has been shed must
fall; not to the subordinates who
ought to be, and almost always
are, the proper objects of mercy.
The most ardent Jacobite, while he
deplored the death, and vindicated
the principles of Lords Balmerino and
Kilmarnock, never thought of blaming
the government of the day for having
sent those devoted noblemen to the
block. But in their case the execution
assumed the character of a terrible
national solemnity&mdash;not hastily
enacted, but following after a deliberate
trial before unprejudiced judges,
upon which the attention and interest
of the whole country was concentrated.
And, therefore, while posterity has
been unanimous in expressing its abhorrence
of the bloody butcheries of
William, Duke of Cumberland, after
the battle of Culloden, no reflection
has been thrown upon the ministers of
George II. for having allowed the law
to take its course against the more
prominent leaders of the rebellion,
even though the sympathies of many
good men have been enlisted on the
losing side. Now, we do not hesitate
to condemn most strongly the conduct
of Austria on the present occasion.
No judicial process, so far as we can
learn, has been instituted against the
captive chiefs, save that which is equivalent
to no process at all&mdash;the sentence
of a court-martial. Except in
cases of the most absolute necessity,
the functions of the soldier and the
judge ought never to be combined and
confounded. When the flame of civil
war is once trodden out, the civil
law ought immediately to resume its
wonted supremacy. Treason and rebellion
are undoubtedly the highest of
all crimes; but, being the highest, it
is therefore the more necessary that
they should be subjected to the gravest
investigation; so that in no way may
the punishment inflicted, on account
of a heinous breach of the law, be
mistaken, even by the most ignorant,
for an act of hurried vengeance. We
may perhaps have no right to object
to the measure of the punishment.
We cannot know what charges were
brought, or even substantiated against
the unfortunate Hungarian leaders of
Arad. We are quite unaware what
disclosures may have been laid before
the Austrian government as to the
participation of Count Bathyany in
Kossuth's republican schemes. One
and all of them may have been guilty
in the worst degree; one and all of
them may have deserved to die; and
it is even possible that circumstances
may have rendered such a terrible
example necessary, for the future preservation
of order; but the manner
in which the punishment has been
dealt, is, we think, wholly indefensible.
It is no answer to say, that the
administration of the laws of Austria
is different from that of our own, and
that we are not entitled to apply the
measure of a foreign standard. No
point of legal technicality, or even
consuetude is involved; there is but
one law which, whatever be its extrinsic
form, ought to regulate such a
proceeding as this&mdash;a law which, we
trust, is acknowledged in Austria as
well as in Britain&mdash;the law of justice
and humanity. The most suspected
criminal, when arraigned before secret
and biassed judges, loses, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg 600]</a></span>
estimation of the public, half his
imputed criminality. He has not
had a fair trial; and, if condemned,
it is possible that his execution may
be considered rather as a case of
martyrdom, than as one of righteous
punishment. A court-martial never
is a satisfactory tribunal; least of all
can it be satisfactory when the object
of its inquiry arises from a civil war.
The judges have seen too much of the
actual misery and ruin which has
occurred to be impartial. That propensity
to vengeance, from which it
can hardly be said that even the
noblest nature is altogether exempt,
so nearly akin is it to righteous indignation,
is at such times unnaturally
excited. The fiery zeal, which shows
so graceful in the soldier, is utterly
unsuited to the ermine; and when the
ermine is thrown, as in this instance,
above the soldier's uniform, there
can be very little doubt that ancient
habit and inflamed passion will
supersede judicial deliberation. By
acting thus, we conscientiously believe
that Austria has inflicted a serious
injury on herself. She has given to
those who are her enemies a heavy
cause of argument and reproach against
those who are her well-wishers; and
the immediate and not unnatural
result will be an increased amount of
sympathy for the political fugitives,
and a great disinclination to canvass
their true motives and their characters.
Francis Joseph at the outset of his
reign will be stigmatised&mdash;most
unjustly, indeed, for the fault lies not
with him&mdash;as a relentless tyrant, and
all who escape from tyranny are sure
of popular though indiscriminate compassion.</p>

<p>We have thought it our duty to
make those remarks at the present
time, because out of this Hungarian
affair a question has arisen in which
we are to a certain extent implicated,
and which may possibly, though we
do not think probably, be productive
of most serious results. We allude,
of course, to the joint demand of
Russia and Austria upon Turkey for
the surrender of the political fugitives
at Widdin. In common with the
whole public press of this country, we
consider such a demand, on general
grounds, to be unexampled and unjust.
The abstract right of every independent
nation to afford shelter to political
fugitives, has, we believe, never
been questioned; but, even had it
been doubtful, there are very many
reasons, founded upon humanity and
honour, why all of us should combine
to protest against a claim so imperiously
and threateningly advanced.
Cases may arise, and have arisen,
where the privilege has been scandalously
abused. For example, the
Baden insurgents have fled for shelter
across the frontier of Switzerland, and
have there remained hatching treason,
collecting adherents, and waiting for
an opportunity of renewing their
treasonable designs. In such a case,
we conceive that the threatened
government has a decided right to
require the sheltering country to
remove or banish those fugitives from
its territory, and in the event of a
refusal, to declare that a proper
<i>casus belli</i>. But this, it will be seen,
is widely different from a demand for
the surrender of the fugitives; and we
presume that, in the case of the
Hungarians, no allegation can be
made, that they have sought harbour,
and remain in Turkey, with a view
towards renewing their attempt. Unquestionably
it is quite competent for
states to enter into treaties in fulfilment
of which political fugitives must
be surrendered when claimed. Such
a treaty is said to exist between
Russia and Turkey; but it is clearly
not applicable in the case of such of
the Hungarian refugees as have claimed
the shelter of the latter power.
Russia, in this quarrel, appears only
as the ally of Austria; and she can
have no right to admit the latter to a
direct participation in any of the
stipulations contained in her peculiar
treaty. No Hungarian is a subject of
Russia; and, therefore, under that
treaty, he cannot possibly be reclaimed.
With regard to the Polish refugees,
there certainly does seem to be
a difference; and we care not to own,
that we feel far less interest for them
than for the Hungarians. Their own
national struggle excited throughout
Europe great sympathy and compassion.
No matter what were the
merits of the kind of government
which they sought to restore&mdash;no man
could be cold-blooded enough to forget
that the kingdom of Poland had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg 601]</a></span>
violently seized and partitioned; and
though sober reason, and, in fact,
good faith, compelled us to abstain
from espousing the cause of those who,
by solemn European treaty, had been
confirmed as subjects but who had
risen as rebels, we yet gave our hospitality
to the fugitive Poles with a
heartiness greater and more sincere
than was ever accorded on any other
occasion. All ranks in this country,
and in France, combined to do them
honour; and the general wish in both
countries was, not to afford them a
mere temporary shelter, but to give
them a permanent habitation. For
this purpose, and to fit them for industrial
employment, the British government
gave an annual grant of money,
and the private subscriptions were
munificent. Some of the exiles most
creditably availed themselves of the
means so placed within their reach,
and have become amongst us useful
and esteemed citizens. But there
were others, and the larger number,
who utterly misinterpreted this sympathy,
and never would abandon their
dreams of Polish restoration. For
this we cannot blame them; and we
must needs allow that they received
much encouragement to persevere in
those dreams from men who ought to
have been wiser. They took undue
advantage of their situation, and preferred
living in idleness, though certainly
not in affluence, upon eleemosynary
aid, to gaining their bread
honourably by active industry and
exertion. This was certainly not the
best way of securing the affection of a
practical people like the British to
them and to their cause; and the result
has been, that the moral prestige of
the Poles has greatly declined in this
country. We are not arguing from
inference, but from facts; for we are
perfectly certain that if the Emperor
Nicholas had made his visit to London
in 1834, instead of nine or ten years
later, his reception by the public
would have been materially different.
Since then, the Poles have altogether
forfeited the esteem of the friends of
order, by coming forward as the
most active agents and instigators
of revolution all over the continent
of Europe. In France, in Italy, in
Germany, and above all, in Hungary,
they have thrust themselves forward
in quarrels with which they had nothing
to do, and even have violated
that hospitality which was accorded
them on account of their misfortunes.
It is time that they should learn that
the British public has no sympathy
with unprincipled condottieri. No
amount of tyranny, inflicted by one
nation, will entitle an exile deliberately
to arm himself against the constitution
of another. Foreign service&mdash;manly
open service indeed is honourable,
but foreign conspiracy is, beyond
all doubt, one of the basest and the
worst of crimes. Now, we are not
versed enough in treaties to know what
are the exact terms of the conditions
made between Russia and Turkey.
We hope, for the sake of Bem, Dembinski,
and the others, that they
merely apply to the surrender of those
who shall take refuge in the neighbouring
territory on account of war
waged, or revolt raised, against their
sovereigns; and though, should such
be the nature of the contract, there
may still be a doubt whether the Poles
are entitled to plead exemption under
it, that doubt, we presume, will be
given in their favour by the sheltering
power; at all events, we think it very
unlikely that any distinction will be
drawn betwixt the two classes of
refugees. Still we are compelled to
maintain our honest and sincere conviction
that, apart from other and
greater considerations, there is nothing
in this demand of Russia and
Austria, to justify us in active interference.
The demand has not been
made on us; it does not refer to
British subjects; and it in no way
concerns our honour. We have nothing
more to do with it, in the
abstract, than if it was a demand
made by the Shah of Persia upon the
Emperor of China. We beg especial
attention to this point, because we
observe that some of our journalists
assume that Great Britain <i>and France</i>
will act together vigorously in resisting
the demand. Now, we hold, that,
though both countries may have a
clear right to protest against such a
demand, on the ground of its being
at variance with the law of nations,
neither of them has the right to make
that a pretext for ulterior measures,
or for resorting to the desperate expedient
of a war. The representatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg 602]</a></span>
of both powers, it is said, have advised
the Porte to return a firm refusal to
the demand; and, since their advice
was asked, we hold that they were
clearly right in doing so. They were
acting merely as assessors, or rather
as expounders of international law.
But suppose that Russia should make
this declinature a <i>casus belli</i> with
Turkey,&mdash;what then? We have in
that case a most decided interest;
because it is part of our policy that
Russia shall not, under any pretext
whatever, lay her hand upon the
Turkish dominions, or force the passage
of the Dardanelles. Our policy
may be wrong, and Mr Cobden thinks,
or thought so: still we are committed
to that view; and we can hardly
escape from interpreting the conduct of
Russia, if she shall persist in enforcing
her demand by dint of arms, into an
overt attempt to get possession of the
Turkish territory. But France has no
such interest as we have. Our reason
for disputing the possession of Turkey
with Russia is a purely selfish one.
We wish to prevent the latter power
from coming into dangerous proximity
with Egypt, and we have a kind of
vague idea that some attack is meditated
upon our Indian provinces. It is
quite possible that these notions may
be visionary or greatly exaggerated,
and that Russia wants nothing more
than an open passage from the Black
Sea&mdash;a right which, if free-trade doctrines
are to be held of universal application,
it does seem rather hard to deny
to her. Still, such is our idea, and in
our present temper we shall probably
act accordingly. But France has no
real interest at stake. She has nothing
to lose, suppose Russia got possession
of Turkey to-morrow; and we
are very much mistaken if she will go
to war from a mere spirit of chivalry,
and in behalf of a few refugees with
whom she is in no way connected.
However disturbed may be the state
of France, or however inflammable
may be the minds of her population,
she has statesmen who will not suffer
her to be committed to so egregious
an act of folly. If Russia perseveres
in her demand to the utmost, on
Britain will fall, in the first instance
at least, the whole weight of the resistance.
We agree with the <i>Times</i>,
that "this demand for the surrender
of the refugees, is either a wanton
outrage for an object too trifling to be
insisted on, or else it masks a more
serious intention of hostility against
the Turkish empire;" but we are not
prepared to adopt the conclusion of
that able journal, that "the governments
and the nations of Western
Europe are resolved to oppose that
demand, even to the last extremity."
On the contrary, we believe that the
opposition would be left to Great
Britain alone.</p>

<p>We trust no apology is necessary
for having wandered from our text
on a topic of so much interest; however,
we ask Mr Cobden's pardon
for having left him uncourteously so
long.</p>

<p>We were remarking that ill-luck
in the way of prophecy and presentiment
still clung to Mr Cobden, even
as Care is said to follow the horseman.
Hungary speedily succumbed, and
Russia did not ask for a loan. Now
that the Hungarians were beaten and
victory impossible, we presume the
next best thing for that unfortunate
people would be to bind up their
wounds, and let them return as speedily
as might be to their usual industrial
employments. Austria, at the conclusion
of the contest, finds herself
largely out of pocket. She has troops
whose pay is greatly in arrear, and she
has made temporary loans which it is
absolutely necessary to discharge.
She might, if she were so disposed,
liquidate the claims of the first, by
letting them loose upon the conquered
Hungarians, from whom they probably
could still contrive to exact a fair
modicum of booty; she might pay off
the latter by resorting to wholesale
confiscation, and by sweeping into
her public treasury whatever the war
has left of value. But Austria has
no desire to proceed to either extremity.
She knows very well that it is
not for her interest that Hungary
should become a sterile waste; and
she is further aware that the best
mode of securing tranquillity for the
future, is to foster industry, and to abstain
from laying any additional burden
upon the already impoverished
people. Therefore, meditating no
further conquest, but, on the contrary,
anxious to sit down to the
sober work of reparation, Austria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></span>
proposes to borrow in the public
money-markets of Europe a sum of
seven millions. The advertisement
meets the eye of Mr Cobden, who
straightway rose in wrath, indited a
letter to a certain Mr Edmund Fry,
ordaining him to convene a public
meeting in London, for the purpose of
considering the said advertisement,
and agreeing "to an address to the
friends of peace and disarmament
throughout the world, on the general
question of loans for war purposes,"
and on the 8th October, the intrepid
orator again mounted on the platform.
This time, we are sorry to remark,
that the meeting was neither so variously
nor so interestingly attended as
before. The Chartists very properly
thought that they had nothing whatever
to do with foreign loans; and,
besides, that they had already been
regaled with an ample allowance of
Mr Cobden's eloquence on the subject.
The two parliamentary poets
were doubtless writing odes, and did
not come. Also there was but a poor
sprinkling of M.P.'s; but Lord Dudley
Stuart was at his post, and Friend
Alexander; and beyond these twain
there appeared no notable whomsoever.
Mr Reynolds must have been
sadly missed.</p>

<p>Mr Cobden's first speech at this
meeting&mdash;for the lack of orators was
such, that he was compelled to indulge
his audience with two&mdash;was a very
dull and dreary affair indeed. He
began first with loans in general, and
went on in his usual style of asseveration.
"I say that, as I have gone
through the length and breadth of
this country with Adam Smith in my
hand to advocate the principles of
free trade, I can stand here with Adam
Smith also in my hand, to denounce,
not merely for its inherent waste of
national wealth, not only because it
anticipates income and consumes capital,
but also on the ground of injustice
to posterity, in saddling upon our
heirs a debt we have no right to call
upon them to pay&mdash;the loans we have
this day met to consider." It is very
hard that unfortunate Adam Smith
should be made answerable for all the
eccentricities of Mr Cobden. Little
did the poor man think, whilst hammering
his brains at Kirkcaldy, that
their product was to be explained at
a future time, according to the sweet
will of so accomplished a commentator!
Adam Smith had a great deal
too much sense to expect that wars
would cease to arise, and government
loans to be contracted. His remark
is not directed against loans, but
against the funding or accumulation
of them, which most of us, in the present
generation, are quite ready to
admit to be all evil. The remedy to
which he pointed, was the establishment
of a sinking-fund to prevent
debt from accumulating; but so long
as Mr Cobden's economical views are
acted on, and the currency maintained
on its present basis, the idea of a
sinking-fund is altogether visionary.
The evil which Adam Smith complains
of is permanent funding, not
loan. There is nothing imprudent in
a man borrowing a thousand pounds
from his banker, if he regularly sets
apart an annual sum out of his income
for its repayment: but it is a very
different thing when he hands over the
debt undiminished for his successor to
discharge.</p>

<p>Having preluded with this little piece
of hocus, Mr Cobden came to the point,
and attempted to show that Austria
was in such a state of insolvency that
it was not safe for any one to lend
money to her. We by no means
object to this sort of exposition. If
it be true that the finances of the
borrowing party are in a dismal state,
we are none the worse for the information;
if the statement is false, it is
sure to be speedily disproved. We
have no objection to concede to Mr
Cobden the possession of that almost
preternatural amount of knowledge,
which is his daily and perpetual boast.
When he tells us that he knows all
about the produce of the mines of
Siberia, because "I have been there,
and I know what is the value of those
mines"&mdash;when he speaks positively
as to the amount of specie in the
vaults of the fortress of St Petersburg,
and states that he knows it&mdash;"because
I have been on the spot,
and made it my business to understand
these things"&mdash;and when, with
regard to the general question of
Russian finance, he observes that
"few men, probably not six men in
England, have had my opportunities
of investigating and ascertaining upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg 604]</a></span>
the best and safest authority on the
spot, where alone you can properly
understand the matter, what actually
is the state of the resources of Russia,"&mdash;we
listen with a kind of awe to the
words of this egotistical Exile of
Siberia. But though not six men in
England are qualified to compete with
him in his knowledge of Russian affairs,
we suspect that it would be no difficult
matter to find six clerks in a single
banking establishment a great deal
better acquainted with the state of
Austrian finance than Mr Cobden.
His object, it would appear, is less to
warn the great capitalists&mdash;who indeed
may be supposed to be perfectly
capable of taking care of themselves&mdash;against
the danger of handing over
their money to Austria, than to secure
the poor labouring man with ten
pounds to spare, against defraudment.
We were not previously aware that
people with ten pounds to spare were
in the habit of investing them in the
foreign funds. We hope to heaven
such is not the case, for we happen to
be acquainted with several very
estimable porters and Celtic chairmen,
who have saved a little money; and,
should the mania for foreign investment
have reached them, we should
tremble to approach any corner of a
street where those excellent creatures
are wont to linger, lest we should
be assailed with the question, "Hoo's
the Peroovian four per cents?"
or, "Div ye ken if they're gaun
to pay the interest on the New
Bonos Areas bonds?" We have
hitherto been labouring under the
delusion that the accumulations of
the working classes were safe in the
British Savings Banks, or Funds; but
we are now sorry to learn from Mr
Cobden that such is not the case. "I
knew myself," said Mr Cobden, "many
years ago, when resident in the city,
a man who worked as a porter on
weekly wages&mdash;his family and himself
being reduced to that state that
they had no other earthly dependence&mdash;and
yet that man had Spanish bonds
to the nominal amount of &pound;2000 in
his pocket. They were not worth
more than waste paper, and came
into the hands of poor men like this
porter, who had no experience and
knowledge in such matters; and it is
to guard such poor men that I now
utter the voice of warning." We
have not read anything more affecting
since we perused <i>The Dairyman's
Daughter</i>. Mr Cobden does not tell
us that he immediately organised a
subscription for the behoof of the
wronged individual; but we think it
probable that he did so, and, if it be
not too late, we shall be glad to contribute
our mite&mdash;on one condition.
The next time Mr Cobden tells this
story, will he be good enough to specify
the precise sum <i>which the porter
paid</i> for those bonds? Our reason
for requiring particular information as
to this point, is founded on a fact
which lately came to our knowledge,
viz. that the name of a promising
chimney-sweep stands recorded in the
books of a certain railway company,
which shall be nameless, as the proprietor
of stock in new shares, to an
amount of nearly double that possessed
by Mr Cobden's acquaintance.
The railway has not paid a single
farthing of dividend, several calls are
still due, and the market price of those
shares is considerably below zero.
The chimney-sweep is a steady young
man, whose only failing is an inveterate
attachment to whisky: he
never was in possession of five pounds
in his life, except on the day when he
became the nominal proprietor of that
stock. We make Mr Cobden a present
of this anecdote, in case he
should have occasion, in the course of
some future crusade, to warn labouring
people against indulging in railway
speculation. It is quite as genuine
and forcible an illustration as his own;
and we suspect that for one person in
the position of the porter, there are
at this moment some hundreds in
possession of transferred certificates,
like the chimney-sweep.</p>

<p>In sober sadness, it is pitiable to
see a man reduced, for sheer lack of
argument, to such wretched clap-trap
as this. The wildest kind of rant
about freedom and tyranny would
have been more to the purpose, and
infinitely more grateful to the popular
ear. Mr Cobden's estimate of his
own position and European importance
is delicious. "I have no hesitation
in saying that there is not a
government in Europe that is not
frowning upon this meeting!" What
a mercy it is that Nicholas had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg 605]</a></span>
suspicion of the tremendous influence
of the man who was once rash enough
to trust himself in his dominions!
We positively tremble at the thought
of what might have ensued had Mr
Cobden been detected on his visit to
the Siberian mines! The governments
of Europe frowning on Mr Cobden's
meeting&mdash;what a subject for the classical
painter!</p>

<p>We need hardly trouble our readers
with any remarks upon the speech of
Lord Dudley Stuart. His monomania
on Continental subjects is well known,
and he carries it so far as to hazard
the most extravagant statements.
For example, he set out with insinuating
that this Austrian loan was
neither more nor less than a deliberate
attempt at swindling, seeing that it had
not received the sanction of the Diet;
"and, consequently," said Lord Dudley,
"nothing could be easier than
for the Austrian government, whenever
they found it inconvenient to pay
the interest of the loan, to turn round
and call those who had advanced the
money very simple people, and tell
them that they ought to have made
due inquiry before parting with it.
It might be said that this would be
a most extraordinary and outrageous
course for any government to adopt;
but they lived in times when monarchs
performed acts of the most
unusual and the most outrageous
description; and it seemed almost
as if the dark ages had returned, such
scenes of barbarity and cruelty were
being enacted throughout Europe, by
order, and in the name of established
governments." Lord Dudley Stuart
is one of those who think that no
crowned head can sit down comfortably
to supper, unless he has previously
immolated a victim. His
idea of the dark ages is derived from
the popular legend of Raw-head and
Bloody-bones. Confiding, and it
would appear with justice, in the singular
ignorance of his audience, he
went on to say:&mdash;"Certain writers
and speakers were never tired of
uttering warnings against the danger
of an infuriated mob. But had any
of those popular outbreaks, as they
were called, ever been attended with
an amount of cruelty, rapine, and
spoliation, to be named in comparison
with the deeds of the despots
of Europe? At Paris, Vienna, and
Rome, for a time, power was in the
hands of the people&mdash;the wild democracy,
as it was called. Where were
their deeds of blood and spoliation?"
Lord Dudley Stuart might just as
well have asked, where were the
victims of the guillotine during the
supremacy of Robespierre. We have
known metaphysicians who could not
be brought to an acknowledgment
that the continent of America has an
actual existence, or that the battle of
Waterloo was ever fought, owing to
what they were pleased to style a
want of sufficient evidence. Lord
Dudley Stuart is precisely in the same
situation. He has patronised foreign
patriots to such an extent, that he believes
every one of them to be a saint;
and if he saw with his own eyes a
democrat piking a proprietor, he
would probably consider it a mere
<i>deceptio visus</i>. Not that he is in the
slightest degree short-sighted, or incredulous,
whenever he can get hold of
a story reflecting on the other side. On
the contrary, he favoured his audience
with a minute description of several
floggings and executions, which he
had, no doubt, received from his
foreign correspondents; and actually
threw the blame of the apostacy of
some of his Polish protegees from the
Christian faith upon the Czar! This
is a topic upon which we would rather
not touch. Men have been known to
deny their Saviour for the sake of
escaping from the most hideous personal
agony, but we never heard before
of apostacy committed for such motives
as Lord Dudley has assigned. "Some,
but very few men, whose lives had
been devoted to fighting against Russia,
and whose religion seemed to consist
in that alone, lured, no doubt, by
the hope of entering the Turkish army,
and again waging war against their
implacable enemies, Russia and Austria,
had been induced to accept the
offers of the Porte, and to embrace
Islamism." We hope it may be long
before we shall be again asked to express
our sympathy for those wretched
renegades from their faith.</p>

<p>Mr Cobden having gathered wind,
again started up; and this time he did
not confine himself to mere economical
prose. We rather think that he
felt slightly jealous of the cheering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg 606]</a></span>
which Lord Dudley Stuart's more animated
speech had elicited; for it is a
well-known fact that the majority of
people would rather listen to the
details of an atrocious murder, than
to a dissertation upon Adam Smith.
Accordingly he came out hot, furious,
pugnacious, and withal remarkably
irrelevant. Throwing aside all consideration
of the Austrian loan, he fell
foul of the Czar, whom he facetiously
compared to Nebuchadnezzar. Listen
to the Apostle of peace! "The man
was incapable of appreciating anything
but a physical-force argument,
and he (Mr Cobden) did not think he
was departing from his peace principles,
in resorting to a mode of admonition
which the nature of the animal
was capable of understanding. He
surely might be excused from admonishing,
if it were possible, a wild
bull, that, if he did not take care, he
might run his head against something
harder even than his own skull. He
therefore said, that if the Emperor of
Russia attacked us, we might hermetically
seal the ports of Russia, and
there would be an end of the matter.
There could be no fighting between
England and Russia. If the question
were put to a jury of twelve competent
men, belonging to any maritime
power, who were perfectly indifferent
to the quarrel, they would at once say
that as England and Russia could not
come to collision by land, the only
question was, what naval force would
be required by England to blockade
Petersburg, Archangel, Odessa and
Riga for six months of the year, and
that the frost would keep up the
blockade for the other six months."
But the best is yet to come. Mr Cobden
is perfectly aware that the sentiments
of such an eminent European
personage as himself must have terrible
weight on the Continent. When the
Czar reads the report of the speeches
delivered at the London Tavern, he will
burst into a paroxysm of fury, order
some hundred serfs to be instantly
knouted to death, and send for the
minister of marine. When it is known
at Vienna that Cobden has declared
against the Austrian loan, Francis
Joseph will gnash his teeth, and desire
Jellachich, Radetsky, and Haynan to
concert measures with his brother emperor
for taking vengeance for this
unparalleled affront. What, then, are
we to do? Is there no danger to Great
Britain from such a combination?
None&mdash;for we have a guarantee. A
greater than Nicholas has promised to
stand between us and peril. People
of Great Britain! read the following

<h2><a name="THE_FRENCH_NOVELS_OF_1849" id="THE_FRENCH_NOVELS_OF_1849"><span class="smcap">THE FRENCH NOVELS OF</span> 1849.</a></h2>


<p>During the twelve months that
have elapsed since we devoted a sheet
of Maga to a flying glance at French
novels and novelists, there has been a
formidable accumulation upon our
shelves of the produce of Paris and
Brussels presses. Were their merit
as considerable as their number, the
regiment of pink, blue, and yellow
octavos and duodecimos would need
a whole magazine to do them justice.
As it is, however, a line a volume
would be too much to devote to some
of them. The lull in literature which
ensued in France, on the shock of the
February revolution, has been succeeded
by a revival of activity. Most
of the old stagers have resumed the
quill, and a few "green hands" have
come forward. As yet, however, the
efforts of the former have in few
instances been particularly happy;
whilst amongst the latter, there is no
appearance worthy of note. Upon
the whole, we think that the ladies
have been at least as successful as the
men. Here is a trio of tales from
feminine pens, as good as anything
that now lies before us. <i>H&eacute;l&egrave;ne</i>, although
it may not greatly augment
the well-established reputation of that
accomplished authoress, Madame
Charles Reybaud, is yet a very pleasing
novel, approaching in character
rather to a graceful English moral
tale, than to the commonly received
idea of a French romance. It is a
story of the first Revolution; the scene
is in Provence, and subsequently at
Rochefort, on board ship, and in
French Guiana. The chief characters
are Helen, and her father, the Count
do Blanquefort, a steadfast royalist,
who traces back his ancestry to the
crusades; her lover, a plebeian and
<i>Montagnard</i>; her godmother, Madame
do Rocabert, and Dom Massiot, a
fanatic priest. Lovers of mysterious
intrigues, and complicated plots, need
not seek them in Madame Reybaud's
novels, whose charm resides for the
most part in elegance of style, graceful
description, and delicate and
truthful delineation of character. In
one of her recent tales&mdash;a very attractive,
if not a very probable one&mdash;<i>Le
Cadet de Colobri&egrave;res</i>, she admirably
sketches the interior of a poor nobleman's
dwelling, where all was pride,
penury, and privation, for appearance
sake. The companion and contrast to
that painful picture, is her description
of the domestic arrangements of
Castle Rocabert, where ease, placidity,
and comfort reign; where the
ancient furniture is solid and handsome,
the apartments commodious,
the cheer abundant; where the antiquated
waiting women, and venerable
serving men, are clad after the most
approved fashion of Louis the Fifteenth's
day, and disciplined in accordance
with the most precious traditions
of aristocratic houses. Madame
de Rocabert herself is a fine portrait,
from the old French r&eacute;gime. Forty
years long has she dwelt in her lonely
chateau, isolated from the world, on
the summit of a cloud-capped rock.
Widowed at the age of twenty of an
adored husband, she shut herself up to
weep, and, as she hoped, to die.
Contrary to her expectation, little by
little she was comforted; she lived,
she grew old. Time and religion had
appeased her sorrow, and dried her
tears. There is a tenderness and
grace in Madame Reybaud's account
of the widow's mourning and consolation,
which reminds us of the exquisite
pathos and natural touches of
Madame d'Arbouville. That such a
comparison should occur to us, is of
itself a high compliment to Madame
Reybaud, who, however, is unquestionably
a very talented writer, and
to the examination of whose collective
works it is not impossible we may
hereafter devote an article. At present,
we pass on to a lady of a different
stamp, who does not very often obtain
commendation at our hands; and
yet, in this instance, we know not why
we should withhold approval from
George Sand's last novel, <i>La Petite
Fadette</i>, one of those seductive trifles
which only Madame Dudevant can
produce, and is free from the pernicious
tendencies that disfigure too many of
her works. In this place we can say
little about it. A sketch of the plot
would be of small interest, for it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg 608]</a></span>
as slight and inartificial as well may
be; and an attempt to analyse the
book's peculiar charm would lead us
a length incompatible with the omnium-gatherum
design of this article.
<i>La Petite Fadette</i> is a story of peasant
habits and superstitions, and these are
treated with that consummate artistical
skill for which George Sand is
celebrated&mdash;every coarser tint of the
picture mellowed and softened, but
never wholly suppressed. Fadette, a
precocious and clever child, and her
brother, a poor deformed cripple,
dwelt with their grandmother, a
beldame cunning in herbs and simples,
and who practises as a sort of quack
doctress. The three are of no good
repute in the country-side; Fadette,
especially, with her large black eyes
and Moorish complexion, her elf-like
bearing and old-fashioned attire, is
alternately feared and persecuted by
the village children, who have nicknamed
her the Cricket. But although
her tongue is sharp, and often malicious,
and her humour wilful and
strange, the gipsy has both heart and
head; and, above all, she has the true
woman's skill to make herself beloved
by him on whom she has secretly
fixed her affections. This is the hero
of the story&mdash;Landry, the handsome
son of a farmer. Love works miracles
with the spiteful slovenly Cricket, who
hitherto has dressed like her grandmother,
and squabbled with all comers.
Although the style of George Sand's
books is little favourable to extract,
and that in this one the difficulty is
increased by the introduction of provincialisms
and peasant phrases, we
will nevertheless translate the account
of Fadette's transformation, and of its
effect upon Landry, upon whom, as
the reader will perceive, the charm
has already begun to work.</p>

<p>"Sunday came at last, and Landry
was one of the first at mass. He
entered the church before the bells
began to ring, knowing that <i>la petite</i>
Fadette was accustomed to come
early, because she always made long
prayers, for which many laughed at
her. He saw a little girl kneeling in
the chapel of the Holy Virgin, but her
back was turned to him, and her face
was hidden in her hands, that she
might pray without disturbance. It
was Fadette's attitude, but it was
neither her head-dress nor her figure,
and Landry went out again to see if
he could not meet her in the porch,
which, in our country, we call the
<i>guenilli&egrave;re</i>, because the ragged beggars
stand there during service. But Fadette's
rags were the only ones he
could not see there. He heard mass
without perceiving her, until, chancing
to look again at the girl who was
praying so devoutly in the chapel, he
saw her raise her head, and recognised
his Cricket, although her dress and
appearance were quite new to him.
The clothes were still the same&mdash;her
petticoat of drugget, her red apron,
and her linen coif without lace; but
during the week she had washed and
re-cut and re-sewn all that. Her gown
was longer, and fell decently over her
stockings, which were very white, as
was also her coif, which had assumed
the new shape, and was neatly set
upon her well-combed black hair; her
neckerchief was new, and of a pretty
pale yellow, which set off her brown
skin to advantage. Her boddice, too,
she had lengthened, and, instead of
looking like a piece of wood dressed
up, her figure was as slender and
supple as the body of a fine honey-bee.
Besides all this, I know not with what
extract of flowers or herbs she had
washed her hands and face during the
week, but her pale face and tiny hands
looked as clear and as delicate as the
white hawthorn in spring.</p>

<p>"Landry, seeing her so changed,
let his prayer-book fall, and at the
noise little Fadette turned herself
about, and her eyes met his. Her
cheek turned a little red&mdash;not redder
than the wild rose of the hedges; but
that made her appear quite pretty&mdash;the
more so that her black eyes,
against which none had ever been
able to say anything, sparkled so
brightly, that, for the moment, she
seemed transfigured. And once more
Landry thought to himself:</p>

<p>"'She is a witch; she wished to
become pretty, from ugly that she
was, and behold the miracle has been
wrought!'</p>

<p>"A chill of terror came over him,
but his fear did not prevent his having
so strong a desire to approach and speak
to her, that his heart throbbed with
impatience till the mass was at an end.</p>

<p>"But she did not look at him again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg 609]</a></span>
and instead of going to run and sport
with the children after her prayers,
she departed so discreetly, that there
was hardly time to notice how
changed and improved she was.
Landry dared not follow her, the less
so that Sylvinet would not leave him
a moment; but in about an hour he
succeeded in escaping; and this time,
his heart urging and directing him, he
found little Fadette gravely tending
her flock in the hollow road which
they call the <i>Traine-au-Gendarme</i>,
because one of the king's gendarmes
was killed there by the people of La
Cosse, in the old times, when they
wished to force poor people to pay
taillage, and to work without wage,
contrary to the terms of the law,
which already was hard enough, such
as they had made it."</p>

<p>But it is not sufficient to win
Landry's heart: Fadette has much
more to overcome. Public prejudice,
the dislike of her lover's family, her
own poverty, are stumbling-blocks,
seemingly insurmountable, in her path
to happiness. She yields not to discouragement;
and finally, by her
energy and discretion, she conquers
antipathies, converts foes into friends,
and attains her ends&mdash;all of which are
legitimate, and some highly praiseworthy.
The narrative of her tribulations,
constancy, and ultimate
triumph, is couched in a style of
studied simplicity, but remarkable
fascination. Slight as it is, a mere
<i>bluette</i>, <i>La Petite Fadette</i> is a graceful
and very engaging story; and it would
be ungrateful to investigate too
closely the amount of varnish applied
by Madame Dudevant to her pictures
of the manners, language, and morals
of French peasantry.</p>

<p><i>La Famille R&eacute;cour</i> is the last book,
by a lady novelist, to which we shall
now refer. It is the best of a series
of six, intended as pictures of French
society, in successive centuries, closing
with the nineteenth. The five previous
novels, which were published
at pretty long intervals, being of no
very striking merit, we were agreeably
surprised by the lively and well-sustained
interest of this romance, the
last, Madame de Bawr informs us,
which she intends to offer to the public.
Paul R&eacute;cour, the penniless nephew
of a rich capitalist, is defrauded
by a forged will of his uncle's inheritance,
which goes to a worthless cousin,
who also obtains the hand of a
girl between whom and Paul an ardent
attachment exists. The chief
interest of the tale hinges on Paul's
struggles, after an interval of deep
despondency, against poverty and the
world&mdash;struggles in which he is
warmly encouraged by his friend Alfred,
a successful <i>feuilletoniste</i> and
dramatic author; and by a warmhearted
but improvident physician, M.
Duvernoy, whose daughter Paul ultimately
marries, out of gratitude, and
to save her from the destitution to
which her father's extravagance and
approaching death are about to consign
her. Paul is a charming character&mdash;a
model of amiability, generosity,
and self-devotion, and yet not too
perfect to be probable. There is a
strong interest in the account of his
combat with adversity, and of the tribulations
arising from the folly and
thoughtlessness of his wife, and the
implacable hostility of his treacherous
cousin. How the story ends
need not here be told. The first four-fifths
of the book entitle it to a high
place amongst the French light literature
of the year 1849; but then it
begins to flag, and the termination is
lame and tame&mdash;a falling off which
strikes the more from its contrast with
the preceding portion. The authoress
appears, in some degree, conscious
of this defect, and prepares her readers
for it in her preface. "The second
volume," she says, "was written
amidst the anguish and alarm which
revolutions occasion to a poor old
woman. Although but ill-satisfied with
my work, I have not courage to recommence
it. I appeal, then, to the reader's
indulgence for my last romance, happy
in the consciousness that my pen has
never traced a single word which was
not dictated by my lively desire to
lead men to virtue." So humble and
amiable an apology disarms criticism.</p>

<p>Having given precedence to the ladies,
we look around for some of their
male colleagues who may deserve a
word. Amongst the new candidates
for the favour of romance-readers is
a writer, signing himself Marquis de
Foudras, and whose debut, if we err
not, was made in conjunction with a
M. de Montepin, in a romance en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg 610]</a></span>titled
<i>Les Ch&eacute;valiers du Lansquenet</i>&mdash;a
long-winded imitation of the Sue
school, extremely feeble, and in execrable
taste, but which, nevertheless,
obtained a sort of circulating library
success. Encouraged by this, Messrs
Foudras and Montepin achieved a
second novel, upon the whole a shade
better than the first; and then, dissolving
their association, set off scribbling,
each "on his own hook;" and
threaten to become as prolific, although
not as popular, as the great Dumas
himself. The last production of M.
de Foudras bears the not unattractive
title of <i>Les Gentilhommes Chasseurs</i>.
It is a series of sporting sketches and
anecdotes, of various merit, in most
of which the author&mdash;who would evidently
convince us that he is a genuine
marquis, and not a plebeian under
a pseudonyme&mdash;himself has cut a more
or less distinguished figure. To the
curious in the science of venery, as
practised in various parts of France,
these two volumes may have some
interest; and the closing and longest
sketch of the series, a tale of shooting
and smuggling adventures in the
Alps, is, we suspect, the best thing
the author has written. Unless, indeed,
we except his account of a stag-hunt
in Burgundy in 1785, in which
he gives a most animated and graphic
account of the mishaps of a dull-dog
of an Englishman, who arrives from
the further extremity of Italy to join
the party of French sportsmen. Of
course Lord Henry is formal, peevish,
and unpolished; the very model, in
short, of an English nobleman. Disdaining
to mount French horses,
which, he politely informs his entertainer,
have no speed, and cannot
leap, he has had four hunters brought
from England, upon one of which,
"a lineal descendant of <i>Arabian Godolphin</i>,
and whose dam was a mare
unconquered at Newmarket," he follows
the first day's hunt, by the side
of a beautiful countess, by whose
charms he is violently smitten, and
who rides a little old Limousin mare, of
piteous exterior, but great merit. The
pace is severe, the country heavy, the
Arabian's grandson receives the go-by
from the Limousin cob, and shows
signs of distress. The following passage
exhibits the author's extraordinary
acquaintance with the customs
and usages of the English hunting-field,&mdash;"We
were still a-head, and
had leaped I know not how many
hedges, ditches, and <i>ravines</i>, when I
observed that Lord Henry, <i>who had
refused to take either a whip or spurs</i>,
struck repeated blows on the flank of
his horse, which, still galloping,
writhed under the pressure of its master's
fist. Looking with more attention,
I presently discovered in <i>milord's</i>
hand a sharp and glittering object, in
which I recognised <i>one of the elegant
chased gold toothpicks</i> which men carried
in those days. I saw at once that
poor <i>C&oelig;ur-de-Lion</i> was done up." In
spite of the toothpick, <i>C&oelig;ur-de-Lion</i>
refuses a leap, whereupon his master
hurls away the singular spur, leaps
from his saddle, draws his hunting-knife,
and plunges it to the hilt in the
horse's breast!&mdash;with which taste of
his quality, we bid a long farewell to
the Marquis de Foudras.</p>

<p>It were strange indeed if the name
of Dumas did not more than once
appear on the numerous title-pages
before us. We find it in half-a-dozen
different places. The amusing Charlatan,
who, in the first fervour and
novelty of the republican regime,
seemed disposed to abandon romance
for politics, has found time to unite
both. Whilst writing a monthly
journal, in which he professes to give
the detailed history of Europe day by
day&mdash;forming, as his puffs assure us,
the most complete existing narrative
of political events since February 1848&mdash;he
has also produced, in the course of
the last twelve months, some twenty-five
or thirty volumes of frivolities.
Thus, whilst with one hand he instructs,
with the other he entertains
the public. For our part, we have
enjoyed too many hearty laughs, both
with and at M. Dumas, not to have
all inclination to praise him when
possible. In the present instance, and
with respect to his last year's tribute
to French literature, we regret to say
it is quite impossible. He has been
trifling with his reputation, and with
the public patience. Since last we
mentioned him, he has added a dozen
volumes to the <i>Vicomte de Bragelonne</i>,
which nevertheless still drags itself
along, without prospect of a termination.
A tissue of greater improbabilities
and absurdities we have rarely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg 611]</a></span>
encountered. Certainly no one but
Alexander Dumas would have ventured
to strain out so flimsy a web to
so unconscionable a length. Are there,
we wonder, in France or elsewhere, any
persons so simple as to rely on his representations
of historical characters
and events? The notions they must
form of French kings and heroes,
courtiers and statesmen, are assuredly
of the strangest. We doubt if, in any
country but France, a writer could
preserve the popularity Dumas enjoys,
who caricatured and made ridiculous,
as he continually does, the greatest
men whose names honour its chronicles.
Besides the wearisome adventures
of Mr Bragelonne and the eternal
Musketeers, M. Dumas has given forth
the first three or four volumes of a
rambling story, founded on the well-known
affair of Marie Antoinette's
diamond necklace. Then he has completed
the account of his Spanish
rambles, which we rather expected
he would have left incomplete, seeing
the very small degree of favour with
which the first instalment of those
most trivial letters was received. In
the intervals of these various labours,
he has thrown off a history of the
regency, and a historical romance, of
which Edward III. of England is the
hero. The latter we have not read.
On French ground, M. Dumas is sometimes
unsuccessful, but when he meddles
with English personages he is invariably
absurd. Finally, and we
believe this closes the catalogue&mdash;although
we will not answer but that
some trifle of half-a-dozen volumes
may have escaped our notice&mdash;M.
Dumas, gliding, with his usual facility
of transition, from the historical to the
speculative, has begun a series of
ghost-stories, whose probable length
it is difficult to foretell, seeing that
what he calls the introduction occupies
two volumes. Some of these tales
are tolerably original, others are old
stories dressed up <i>&agrave; la Dumas</i>. They
are preceded by a dedication to M.
Dumas' former patron, the Duke of
Montpensier, and by a letter to his
friend V&eacute;ron, editor of the <i>Constitutionnel</i>,
theatrical manager, &amp;c. These
two epistles are by no means the least
diverting part of the book. M. Dumas,
whom we heard of, twenty months
ago, as a fervid partisan and armed
supporter of the republic, appears to
have already changed his mind, and
to hanker after a monarchy. Some
passages of his letter to his friend are
amusingly conceited and characteristic.
"My dear V&eacute;ron," he writes,
"you have often told me, during those
evening meetings, now of too rare occurrence,
where each man talks at
leisure, telling the dream of his heart,
following the caprice of his wit,
or squandering the treasures of his
memory&mdash;you have often told me, that,
since Scheherazade, and after Nodier,
I am one of the most amusing narrators
you know. To-day you write to
me that, <i>en attendant</i> a long romance
from my pen&mdash;one of my interminable
romances, in which I comprise a whole
century&mdash;you would be glad of some
tales, two, four, or six volumes at
most&mdash;poor flowers from my garden&mdash;to
serve as an interlude amidst the
political preoccupations of the moment:
between the trials at Bourges,
for instance, and the elections of the
month of May. Alas! my friend, the
times are sad, and my tales, I warn
you, will not be gay. Weary of what
I daily see occurring in the real world,
you must allow me to seek the subjects
of my narratives in an imaginary
one. Alas! I greatly fear that all
minds somewhat elevated, somewhat
poetical and addicted to reverie, are
now situated similarly to mine; in
quest&mdash;that is to say, of the ideal&mdash;sole
refuge left us by God against
reality." After striking this desponding
chord, the melancholy poet of
elevated mind proceeds to regret
the good old times, to deplore
the degeneracy of the age, to declare
himself inferior to his grandfather,
and to express his conviction that his
son will be inferior to himself. We
are sorry for M. Dumas, junior. "It
is true," continues Alexander, "that
each day we take a step towards
liberty, equality, fraternity, three
great words which the Revolution of
1793&mdash;you know, the other, the dowager&mdash;let
loose upon modern society
as she might have done a tiger, a lion,
and a bear, disguised in lambskins;
empty words, unfortunately, which
were read, through the smoke of June,
on our public monuments all battered
with bullets." After so reactionary a
tirade, let M. Dumas beware lest, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[Pg 612]</a></span>
the first fight that occurs in Paris
streets, a Red cartridge snatch him
from an admiring world. His moan
made for republican illusions, he proceeds
to cry the coronach over French
society, unhinged, disorganised, destroyed,
by successive revolutions.
And he calls to mind a visit he paid,
in his childhood, to a very old lady, a
relic of the past century, and widow
of King Louis Philippe's grandfather,
to whom Napoleon paid an annuity of
one hundred thousand crowns&mdash;for
what? "<i>For having preserved in her
drawing-rooms the traditions of good
society of the times of Louis XIV.
and Louis XV.</i> It is just half what
the chamber now gives his nephew
for making France forget what his
uncle desired she should remember."
Take that, President Buonaparte, and
go elsewhere for a character than to
the <i>D&eacute;bit de Romans</i> of Mr Alexander
Dumas. How is it you have neglected
to propitiate the suffrage of the
melancholy poet? Repair forthwith
the omission. Summon him to the
Elys&eacute;e. Pamper, caress, and consult
him, or tremble for the stability of
your presidential chair! After Louis
Napoleon, comes the turn of the legislative
chamber; apropos of which M.
Dumas quotes the Marquis d'Argenson's
memoirs, where the courtier of
1750 bewails the degeneracy of the
times neither more nor less than does
the dramatic author of a century
later. "People complain," M. d'Argenson
says, "that in our day there
is no longer any conversation in
France. I well know the reason. It
is that our cotemporaries daily become
less patient listeners. They
listen badly, or rather they listen not
at all. I have remarked this in the
very best circles I frequent." "Now,
my dear friend," argues M. Dumas,
with irresistible logic, "what is the
best society one can frequent at the
present day? Very certainly it is that
which eight millions of electors have
judged worthy to represent the interests,
the opinions, the genius of
France. It is the chamber, in short.
Well! enter the chamber, at a venture,
any day and hour that you
please. The odds are a hundred to
one, that you will find one man
speaking in the tribune, and five or
six hundred others sitting on the
benches, not listening, but interrupting
him. And this is so true, that
there is an article of the constitution
of 1848 prohibiting interruptions.
Again, reckon the number of boxes
on the ear, and fisticuffs given in the
chamber during a year that it has
existed&mdash;they are innumerable. All
in the name&mdash;be it well understood&mdash;of
liberty, equality, and fraternity!"
Rather strange language in the mouth
of a citizen of the young republic;
and its oddness diminishes the surprise
with which we find, on turning
the page, the captor of the Tuileries
paying his devoirs to the most presently
prosperous member of the
house of Orleans. "Monseigneur,"
he says, to the illustrious husband of
the Infanta Louisa, "this book is
composed for you, written purposely
for you. Like all men of elevated
minds, you believe in the impossible,"
&amp;c. &amp;c. Then a flourish about
Galileo, Columbus, and Fulton, and
a quotation from Shakspeare, some
of whose plays M. Dumas has been
so condescending as to translate and
improve. Then poor Scheherazade is
dragged in again, always apropos of
"I, Alexander," and then, the flourish
of trumpets over, the fun begins and
phantoms enter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Although not generally partial to
tales of <i>diablerie</i>&mdash;a style which the
Germans have overdone, and in which
few writers of other nations have succeeded&mdash;we
have been much amused
by the story of <i>Jean le Trouveur</i>, in
which, upon the old yarn of a pact
with the evil one, M. Paul de Musset
has strung a clever and spirited series
of Gil-Blas-like adventures, interspersed
with vivid glimpses of historical
events and personages, with here
and there a garnishing of quiet satire.
"The life of Jean le Trouveur," says
the ingenious and painstaking author
of these three pleasant little volumes,
"is one of those histories which the
people tell, and nobody has written....
This fantastical personage
is known in several countries, under
different names. In Provence he is
called Jean l'Heureux; in Arragon,
Don Juan el Pajarero&mdash;that is to say,
the Fowler or Birdcatcher; in Italy
Giovanni il Trovatore. His real name
will be found in the course of the fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[Pg 613]</a></span>lowing
narration. His death was
related to me in Lower Brittany,
where I did not expect to meet with
him. This circumstance decided me
to write his history, uniting the various
chronicles, whose connexion is
evident." That accomplished antiquarian
and legendary, M. Prosper
M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, would doubtless be able to
tell us whether this be a mere author's
subterfuge, or a veritable account of
the sources whence M. de Musset derived
the amusing adventures of John
the Finder. We ourselves are not
sufficiently versed in the traditions of
Provence and Italy, Arragon and
Brittany, to decide, nor is it of much
interest to inquire. M. de Musset
may possibly have found the clay, but
he has made the bricks and built the
house. It is a light and pleasant
edifice, and does him credit.</p>

<p>The main outline of the story of
<i>Jean le Trouveur</i> is soon told, and
has no great novelty. The interest
lies in the varied incidents that crowd
every chapter. In the year 1699
there dwelt at Arles, in Provence,
a commander of Malta, by name
Anthony Quiqueran, Lord of Beaujeu.
After an adventurous career, and innumerable
valiant exploits achieved
in the wars of the Order against Turks
and barbarians; after commanding
the galleys of Malta in a hundred
successful sea-fights, and enduring a
long captivity in the fortress of the
Seven Towers, this brave man, at the
age of nearly eighty years, dwelt
tranquilly in his castle of Beaujeu,
reposing, in the enjoyment of perfect
health, from the fatigues of his long
and busy life, and awaiting with
seeming resignation and confidence
the inevitable summons of death.
Only two peculiarities struck the
neighbours of the old knight: one of
which was, that he avoided speaking
of his past adventures; the other,
that he would attend mass but at a
particular convent, and that even
there he never entered the chapel,
but kneeled on a chair in the porch,
his face covered with his hands, until
the service was concluded. It was
supposed by many that he was bound
by a vow, and that his conduct was a
mark of penitence and humiliation.
And although the commander never
went to confession, or the communion
table, his life was so pure, his
charities were so numerous, and he
had rendered such great services to
the cause of religion, that none ventured
to blame his eccentricities and
omissions. But one stormy day a
little old Turk, the fashion of whose
garments was a century old, landed
from a brigantine, which had made
its way up the Rhone in spite of wind,
and, to the wonder of the assembled
population, approached the commander
of Malta, and said to him&mdash;"Anthony
Quiqueran, you have but three days
left to fulfil your engagements." An
hour later, the old knight is in the
convent chapel, assisting at a mass,
which he has requested the superior
to say for him. But when the priest
takes the sacred wafer it falls from
his hands, a gust of wind extinguishes
the tapers, and a confused murmur of
voices is heard in the lateral nave of
the church. In spite of himself, the
officiant utters a malediction instead
of a prayer, and, horror-stricken, he
descends the steps of the altar, at
whose foot M. de Beaujeu lies senseless,
his face against the ground. The
ensuing chapters contain the commander's
confession. Long previously,
when languishing in hopeless captivity
in a Turkish dungeon, he had
made a compact with a demon, by
which he was to enjoy liberty and
health, and thirty years of glory and
good fortune. At the end of that
term he must find another person to
take his place on similar conditions,
or his soul was the property of the
fiend. Scarcely was the bargain concluded,
when he doubted its reality,
and was disposed to attribute it to
the delirium of fever. In the uncertainty,
he studiously abstained from
the advantage of the compact, hoping
thereby to expiate its sin. His
health returned, his liberty was given
him, but he sought neither glory, nor
wealth, nor honours, living retired
upon ten thousand crowns a-year, the
gift of the King of France and other
princes, for his services to Christendom,
practising good works, and cultivating
his garden. He began to
hope that this long course of virtue
and self-denial had redeemed his sin,
when the warning of the demon, in
the garb of the Turkish captain,
renewed his alarm, and the inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[Pg 614]</a></span>rupted
mass convinced him of the
graceless state of his soul. No act
of penitence, the superior now assured
him, could atone his crime. Too
high-minded to seek a substitute, and
endeavour to shift its penalty upon
another's shoulders, M. de Beaujeu
attempts the only reparation in his
power, by bequeathing half his wealth
to charities. To inherit the other
moiety, he entreats the superior to
select a foundling worthy of such
good fortune. The superior is not at
a loss. "I have got exactly what
you want," he says; "the chorister
who answered at the mass at which
you swooned away has no relations.
I picked him up in the street on a
winter's night, fourteen years ago,
and since then he has never left me.
He has no vocation for the church,
and you will do a good action in restoring
him to the world." The chorister
boy, who had been baptised
Jean le Trouv&eacute;, is sent for, but cannot
at first be found; for the excellent
reason that, hidden in the recesses of
the superior's bookcase, behind a row
of enormous folios, he had listened
to all that had passed between the
commander and the monk. As soon
as he can escape he repairs to the
castle of Beaujeu, where his good
looks, his simplicity and vivacity, interest
the old knight, who receives
him kindly, resolves to make him his
heir, and sends him back to the convent
to announce his determination
to the superior. The foundling is
grateful. His joy at his brilliant
prospects is damped by the recollection
of the commander's confession
and despair. He resolves to astonish
his benefactor by the greatness of his
gratitude. The following extract,
which has a good deal of the <i>Hoffmannsche</i>
flavour, will show how he
sets about it.</p>

<p>In the street of La Trouille, which
took its name from the fortress built
by the Emperor Constantine, dwelt a
barber, who, to follow the mode of
the barbers and bath-keepers of Paris,
sold wine and entertained gamesters.
Young men, sailors, merchants, and
citizens of Arles, resorted to his shop&mdash;some
to transact business; others to
discuss matters of gallantry or pleasure;
others, again, to seek dupes.
Of a night, sounds of quarrel were
often heard in the shop, to which the
town-archers had more than once
paid a visit. If a stranger staked
his coin on a turn of the cards, or
throw of the dice, it was no mere
hazard that transferred his ducats to
the pockets of the regular frequenters
of the house. Seated upon a post,
opposite to this honest establishment,
John the Foundling watched each face
that entered or came out. After
some time, he saw approaching from
afar the captain of the brigantine,
with his flat turban and his great
matchlock pistol. When the Turk
reached the barber's door, John
placed himself before him.</p>

<p>"Sir stranger," said the boy, "did
you not arrive here this morning from
the East, on important business which
concerns the Commander de Beaujeu?"</p>

<p>"<i>Si</i>," replied the Turk; "but I
may also say that it is business which
concerns you not."</p>

<p>"You mistake," said John; "it
does concern me, and I come on purpose
to speak to you about it."</p>

<p>"'Tis possible," said the old captain;
"<i>ma mi non voler, mi non poter,
mi non aver tempo</i>."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," firmly retorted
John, "you must find time to hear
me. What I have to communicate to
you is of the utmost importance."</p>

<p>"Do me the pleasure <i>de andar al
diable</i>!" cried the Turk, in his Franco-Italian
jargon.</p>

<p>"I am there already," replied the
lad; "rest assured that I know who
you are. I will not leave you till
you have given me a hearing."</p>

<p>The old Mussulman, who had hitherto
averted his head to try to break
off the conversation, at last raised his
melancholy and aquiline countenance.
With his yellow eyes he fixed an
angry gaze upon the chorister, and
said to him in a full strong voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, enter this shop with me.
We will presently speak together."</p>

<p>There was company in the barber's
shop of the Rue de la Trouille, when
little John and the captain of the
brigantine raised the curtain of checked
linen which served as a door. In a
corner of the apartment, four men,
seated round a table, were absorbed
in a game at cards, to which they
appeared to pay extreme attention,
although the stake was but of a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[Pg 615]</a></span>
miserable sous. One of the gamblers
examined, with the corner of his eye,
the two persons who entered; and,
seeing it was only a lad and a Turk
of mean and shabby appearance, he
again gave all his attention to the
game. The master of the shop conceived
no greater degree of esteem
for the new comers, for he did not
move from the stool on which he was
sharpening his razors. At the further
end of the apartment a servant stood
beside the fire, and stirred with a stick
the dirty linen of the week, which
boiled and bubbled in a copper caldron.
A damaged hour-glass upon a board
pretended to mark the passage of
time; and small tables, surrounded
with straw-bottomed stools, awaited
the drinkers whom evening usually
brought. Bidding the chorister to be
seated, the captain of the brigantine
placed himself at one of the tables,
and called for wine for all the company.
The barber hasted to fetch a
jug of Rhone wine, and as many
goblets as there were persons in the
room. When all the glasses were
filled, the captain bid the barber distribute
them, and exclaimed, as he
emptied his own at a draft.&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>A la salute de Leurs Seigneuries!</i>"</p>

<p>Thereupon the four gamblers exchanged
significant glances, whispered
a few words, and then, as if the
politeness of the Turkish gentleman
had caused them as much pleasure as
surprise, they pocketed their stakes
and discontinued their game. With
gracious and gallant air, and smiling
countenance, one hand upon the hip
and the other armed with the goblet,
the four gentlemen approached the
old Turk with a courteous mien, intended
to eclipse all the graces of the
courtiers of Versailles. But there
was no need of a magnifying-glass to
discern the true character of the four
companions; the adventurer was detectible
at once in their threadbare
coats, their collars of false lace, and
in the various details of their dress,
where dirt and frippery were ill concealed
by trick and tawdry. A moderately
experienced eye would easily
have seen that it was vice which had
fattened some of them, and made
others lean. The most portly of the
four, approaching the Turkish gentleman,
thanked him in the name of his
friends, and placed his empty glass
upon the table with so polite and
kindly an air, that the Turk, touched
by his good grace, took the wine jug
and refilled the four goblets to the
brim. Some compliments were exchanged,
and all sorts of titles used; so
that by the time the jug was empty
they had got to calling each other
Excellency. The barber, putting his
mouth to the captain's ear, with such
intense gravity that one might have
thought him angry, assured him that
these gentlemen were of the very first
quality, whereat the Turk testified
his joy by placing his hand on his lips
and on his forehead. In proportion
as mutual esteem and good understanding
augmented, the contents of
the jug diminished. A second was
called for; it was speedily emptied in
honour of the happy chance that had
brought the jovial company together.
A third disappeared amidst promises
of frequent future meetings, and a
fourth was drained amidst shaking of
hands, friendly embraces, and unlimited
offers of service.</p>

<p>The barber, a man of taste, observed
to his guests, that four jugs
amongst five persons made an uneven
reckoning, which it would need the
mathematical powers of Bar&ecirc;me duly
to adjust. For symmetry's sake,
therefore, a fifth jug was brought, out
of which the topers drank the health
of the king, of their Amphitryon, and
of Bar&ecirc;me, so appositely quoted. The
four seedy gentlemen greatly admired
the intrepidity with which the little
old man tossed off his bumpers.
Their project of making the captain
drunk was too transparent to escape
any spectator less innocent than the
chorister; but in vain did they seek
signs of intoxication on the imperturbable
countenance of the old Turk.
In reply to each toast and protestation
of friendship, the captain emptied his
glass, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Much obliged, gentlemen; <i>mi trop
flatt&eacute;</i>."</p>

<p>No sparkle of the eyes, no movement
of the muscles, broke the monotony
of his faded visage. His parchment
complexion preserved its yellow
tint. On the other hand, the cheeks
of the four adventurers began to flush
purple; they unbuttoned their doublets,
and used their hats as fans. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span>
signs of intoxication they watched for
in their neighbour were multiplied in
their own persons. At last they got
quite drunk. He of the four whose
head was the coolest proposed a game
at cards.</p>

<p>"I plainly see," said the Turk, accepting,
"that the <i>Signori n'esser pas
joueurs per habitude</i>."</p>

<p>"And how," exclaimed one of the
adventurers, "did your excellency
infer from our physiognomy that incontestible
truth?"</p>

<p>"<i>Perch&eacute;</i>," replied the Turk, "on
my arrival you broke off in the middle
of your game. A professed gambler
never did such a thing."</p>

<p>They were in ecstasies at the noble
foreigner's penetration, and they called
for the dice. When the captain drew
forth his long purse, stuffed with <i>g&eacute;nov&egrave;ses</i>,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
the four gentlemen experienced
a sudden shock, as if a thunderbolt
had passed between them without
touching them, and this emotion half
sobered them. The Turk placed one
of the large gold pieces upon the
table, saying he would hold whatever
stake his good friends chose to venture.
The others said that a <i>g&eacute;nov&egrave;se</i> was a
large sum, but that nothing in the
world should make them flinch from
the honour of contending with so
courteous an adversary. By uniting
their purses, they hoped to be able to
hold the whole of his stake. And
accordingly, from the depths of their
fobs, the gentlemen produced so many
six-livre and three-livre pieces, that
they succeeded in making up the
thirty-two crowns, which were equivalent
to the <i>g&eacute;nov&egrave;se</i>. They played
the sum in a rubber. The Turk won
the first game, then the second; and
the four adventurers, on beholding
him sweep away their pile of coin,
were suddenly and completely sobered.
The captain willingly agreed to give
them their revenge. The difficulty
was to find the two-and-thirty crowns.
By dint of rummaging their pockets,
the gentlemen exhibited four-and-twenty
livres: but this was only a
quarter of the sum. The oldest of the
adventurers then took the buckle from
his hat, and threw it on the table,
swearing by the soul of his uncle that
the trinket was worth two hundred
livres, although even the simple chorister
discerned the emeralds that
adorned it to be but bits of bottle-glass.
Like a generous player, the
old Turk made no difficulties; he
agreed that the buckle should stand
for two hundred livres, and it was
staked to the extent of twenty-four
crowns. This time the dice was so
favourable to the captain, that the
game was not even disputed. His
adversaries were astounded: they
twisted their mustaches till they
nearly pulled them up by the roots;
they rubbed their eyes, and cursed
the good wine of Rhone. In the third
game, the glass jewel, already pledged
for twenty-four crowns, passed entire
into the possession of the Turk. Then
the excited gamblers threw upon the
table their rings, their sword-knots,
and the swords themselves, assigning
to all these things imaginary value,
which the Turk feigned to accept as
genuine. Not a single game did they
win. The captain took a string, and
proceeded to tie together the tinsel
and old iron he had won, when he
felt a hand insinuate itself into the
pocket of his ample hose. He seized
this hand, and holding it up in the
air&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Messirs</i>," he said, "<i>vous esser des
coquins. Mi saper que vous aver
trich&eacute;.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Trich&eacute;!</i>" cried one of the sharpers.
"He strips us to the very shirt, and then
accuses us of cheating! <i>Morbleu!</i>
Such insolence demands punishment."</p>

<p>A volley of abuse and a storm of
blows descended simultaneously upon
the little old man. The four adventurers,
thinking to have an easy bargain
of so puny a personage, threw
themselves upon him to search his
pockets; but in vain did they ransack
every fold of his loose garments.
The purse of gold <i>g&eacute;nov&egrave;ses</i> was not
to be found; and unfortunately the old
Turk, in his struggles, upset the tripod
which supported the copper caldron.
A flood of hot water boiled about the
legs of the thieves, who uttered
lamentable cries. But it was far
worse when they saw the overturned
caldron continue to pour forth its
scalding stream as unceasingly as the
allegoric urn of Scamander. The four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span>sharpers and the barber, perched upon
stools, beheld, with deadly terror, the
boiling lake gradually rising around
them. Their situation resembled that
in which Homer has placed the valiant
and light-footed Achilles; but as these
rogues had not the intrepid soul of the
son of Peleus, they called piteously
upon God and all the saints of paradise;
mingling, from the force of
habit, not a few imprecations with
their prayers. The wizened carcase
of the old Turk must have been proof
against fire and water, for he walked
with the streaming flood up to his
knees. Lifting the chorister upon his
shoulders, he issued, dry-footed, from
the barber's shop, like Moses from the
bosom of the Red Sea. The river of
boiling water waited but his departure
to re-enter its bed. This prodigy
suddenly took place, without any one
being able to tell how. The water
subsided, and flowed away rapidly,
leaving the various objects in the shop
uninjured, with the exception of the
legs of the four adventurers, which
were somewhat deteriorated. The
servant, hurrying back at sound of the
scuffle, raised the caldron, and resumed
the stirring of her dirty linen,
unsuspicious of the sorcery that had
just been practised. The barber and
the four sharpers took counsel together,
and deliberated amongst themselves
whether it was proper to denounce
the waterproof and incombustible
old gentleman to the authorities.
The quantity of hot water that
had been spilled being out of all
proportion with the capacity of the
kettle, it seemed a case for hanging or
burning alive the author of the infernal
jest. The barber, however,
assured his customers that learned
physicians had recently made many
marvellous discoveries, in which the
old Turk might possibly be versed.
He also deemed it prudent not lightly
to put himself in communication with
the authorities, lest they should seek
to inform themselves as to the manner
in which the cards were shuffled
in his shop. It was his opinion that
the offender should be generously pardoned,
unless, indeed, an opportunity
occurred of knocking him on the head
in some dark corner. This opinion
met with general approbation.</p>

<p>Whilst this council of war is held,
Jean and the old Turk are in confabulation,
and a bargain is at last
concluded, by which the commander's
soul is redeemed, and Jean is to have
five years of earthly prosperity, at the
end of which time, if he has failed to
find a substitute, his spiritual part
becomes the demon's property. Two
years later we find Jean upon the
road to Montpellier, well mounted and
equipped, and his purse well lined.
Although but in his eighteenth year,
he is already a gay gallant, with some
knowledge of the world, and eager for
adventures. These he meets with in
abundance. A mark, imprinted upon
his arm by his attendant demon,
causes him to be recognised as the son
of the Chevalier de Cerdagne. Thus
ennobled, he feels that he may aspire
to all things, and soon we find him
pushing his fortune in Italy, attached
to the person of the French Marshal
de Marchin, discovering the Baron
d'Isola's conspiracy against the life of
Philip V. of Spain, and gaining laurels
in the campaigns of the War of Succession.
There is much variety and
interest in some of his adventures, and
the supernatural agency is sufficiently
lost sight of not to be wearisome.
Time glides away, and the fatal term
of five years is within a few days of
its completion. But <i>Jean le Trouv&eacute;</i>,
now <i>le Trouveur</i>, is in no want of
substitutes. Two volunteers present
themselves; one his supposed sister,
Mademoiselle de Cerdagne, whom he
has warmly befriended in certain love
difficulties; the other a convent gardener,
whom he has made his private
secretary, and whose name is Giulio
Alberoni. The demon, who still affects
the form of an old Turkish sailor,
receives Alberoni in lieu of Jean, to
whom, however,&mdash;foreseeing that the
young man's good fortune may be the
means of bringing him many other
victims&mdash;he offers a new contract on
very advantageous terms. But Jean
de Cerdagne, who is now Spanish
ambassador at Venice, with the title
of prince, and in the enjoyment of
immense wealth, refuses the offer,
anxious to save his soul. He soon
discovers that his good fortune is at
an end. The real son of the Chevalier
de Cerdagne turns up, Jean is
disgraced, stripped of his honours and
dignities, and his vast property is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span>
confiscated by the Inquisition. The
ex-ambassador exchanges for a squalid
disguise his rich costume of satin and
velvet, and we next find him a member
of a secret society in the thieves'
quarter of Venice. The worshipful
fraternity of Chiodo&mdash;so called from
their sign of recognition, which is a rusty
nail&mdash;live by the exercise of various
small trades and occupations, which,
although not strictly beggary or theft,
are but a degree removed from these
culpable resources. Jean, whose conscience
has become squeamish, will
accept none but honest employment.
But the malice of the demon pursues
him, and he succeeds in nothing. He
stations himself at a ferry to catch
gondolas with a boat-hook, and bring
them gently alongside the quay; he
stands at a bridge stairs, to afford
support to passengers over the stones,
slippery with the slime of the lagoons;
he takes post in front of the Doge's
palace, with a vessel of fresh water
and a well-polished goblet, to supply
passers-by. Many accept his stout
arm, and drink his cool beverage, but
none think of rewarding him. Not
all his efforts and attention are sufficient
to coax a sou from the pockets
of his careless customers. At last,
upon the third day, he receives a piece
of copper, and trusts that the charm
is broken. The coin proves a bad one.
His seizure by the authorities, and
transportation to Zara, relieve him of
care for his subsistence. At last,
pushed by misery, and in imminent
danger of punishment for having struck
a Venetian officer, Jean succumbs to
temptation, and renews his infernal
compact. A Venetian senator adopts
him, and he discovers, but too late,
that had he delayed for a few minutes
his recourse to diabolical aid, he would
have stood in no need of it. He
proceeds to Spain, where he has many
adventures and quarrels with his former
secretary, Alberoni, now a powerful
minister. His contract again at
an end, he would gladly abstain from
renewing it, but is hunted by the Inquisition
into the arms of the fiend.
After a lapse of years, he is again
shown to us in Paris, and, finally, in
Brittany, where he meets his death,
but, at the eleventh hour, disappoints
the expectant demon, (who in a manner
outwits himself,) and re-enters
the bosom of the church, his bad
bargain being taken off his hands by
an ambitious village priest. The
book, which has an agreeable vivacity,
closes with an attempt to explain
a portion of its supernatural incidents
by a reference to popular tradition
and peasant credulity. Near the ramparts
of the Breton town of Gu&eacute;rande,
an antiquary shows M. de Musset
a moss-grown stone, with a Latin
epitaph, which antiquary and novelist
explain each after his own
fashion.</p>

<p>"Let us see if you understand that,
<i>M. le Parisien</i>," said the antiquary.
"Up to the two last words we shall
agree; but what think you of the
<i>Ars. Inf.</i>?"</p>

<p>"It appears to me," I replied,
"that the popular chronicle perfectly
explains the whole epitaph&mdash;<i>Ars. Inf.</i>
means <i>ars inferna</i>; that is to say,&mdash;'Here
reposes Jean Capello, citizen
of Venice, whose body was sent to
the grave, and his soul to heaven, by
infernal artifices.'"</p>

<p>"A translation worthy of a romance
writer," said the antiquary. "You
believe then in the devil, in compact
with evil spirits, in absurd legends
invented by ignorance and superstition
amidst the evening gossip of our
peasants? You believe that, in 1718,
a parish priest of Gu&eacute;rande flew away
into the air, after having redeemed the
soul of this Jean Capello. You are
very credulous, M. le Parisien. This
Venetian, who came here but to die, was
simply poisoned by the priest, who
took to flight; the town doctor, having
opened the body, found traces of
the poison. That is why they engraved
upon the tomb these syllables:
<i>Ars. Inf.</i>, which signify <i>arsenici infusio</i>,
an infusion of arsenic. I will
offer you another interpretation&mdash;Jean
Capello was perhaps a salt-maker,
killed by some accident in our salt-works,
and as in 1718 labourers of
that class were very miserable, they
engraved upon this stone, to express
the humility of his station, <i>Ars. Inf.</i>,
that is to say, inferior craft."</p>

<p>"Upon my word!" I exclaimed,
"that explanation is perfectly absurd.

<p>We see little else worthy of extract
or comment in the mass of books
before us. M. M&eacute;ry, whose extraordinary
notions of English men and
things we exhibited in a former article,
has given forth a rhapsodical history,
entitled <i>Le Transport&eacute;</i>, beginning
with the Infernal Machine, and ending
with Surcouf the Pirate, full of
conspiracies, dungeons, desperate sea-fights,
and tropical scenery, where
English line-of-battle ships are braved
by French corvettes, and where the
transitions are so numerous, and the
variety so great, that we may almost
say everything is to be found in its
pages, except probability. Mr Dumas
the younger, who follows at respectful
distance in his father's footsteps,
and publishes a volume or two per
month, has not yet, so far as we have
been able to discover, produced anything
that attains mediocrity. M.
Sue has dished up, since last we have
adverted to him, two or three more
capital sins, his illustrations of which
are chiefly remarkable for an appearance
of great effort, suggestive of the
pitiable plight of an author who, having
pledged himself to public and
publishers for the production of a
series of novels on given subjects, is
compelled to work out his task, however
unwilling his mood. This is
certainly the most fatal species of
book-making&mdash;a selling by the cubic
foot of a man's soul and imagination.
Evil as it is, the system is largely
acted upon in France at the present
day. Home politics having lost much
of the absorbing interest they possessed
twelve months ago, the Paris
newspapers are resorting to their old
stratagems to maintain and increase
their circulation. Prominent amongst
these is the holding out of great attractions
in the way of literary
feuilletons. Accordingly, they contract
with popular writers for a name
and a date, which are forthwith
printed in large capitals at the head
of their leading columns. Thus, one
journal promises its readers six volumes
by M. Dumas, to be published
in its feuilleton, to commence on a
day named, and to be entitled <i>Les
Femmes</i>. The odds are heavy, that
Alexander himself has not the least
idea what the said six volumes are
to be about; but he relies on his fertility,
and then so vague and comprehensive
a title gives large latitude.
Moreover, he has time before him,
although he has promised in the interval
to supply the same newspaper
with a single volume, to be called
<i>Un Homme Fort</i>, and to conclude the
long procession of <i>Fant&ocirc;mes</i>, a thousand
and one in number, which now
for some time past has been gliding
before the astonished eyes of the
readers of the <i>Constitutionnel</i>. Other
journals follow the same plan with
other authors, and in France no
writer now thinks of publishing a
work of fiction elsewhere than at the
foot of a newspaper. To this feuilleton
system, pushed to an extreme,
and entailing the necessity of introducing
into each day's fragment an
amount of incident mystery or pungent
matter, sufficient to carry the
reader over twenty-four hours, and
make him anxious for the morrow's
return, is chiefly to be attributed the
very great change for the worse that
of late has been observable in the
class of French literature at present
under consideration. Its actual condition
is certainly anything but vigorous
and flourishing, and until a
manifest improvement takes place,
we are hardly likely again to pass it
in review.</p>

<p>Five weeks to-day since we pitched our Camp&mdash;and we have had the

that one Wind Instrument is slightly out of tune&mdash;he is most anxious

<p>"The most perfect instance of this kind is the Tragedy of Macbeth, in which
the character of an ungrateful traitor, murderer, usurper, and tyrant, is made
in the highest degree interesting by the sublime flashes of generosity, magnanimity,
courage, and tenderness, which continually burst forth in the manly
but ineffective struggle of every exalted quality that can dignify and adorn
the human mind, first against the allurements of ambition, and afterwards
against the pangs of remorse and horrors of despair. Though his wife has
been the cause of all his crimes and sufferings, neither the agony of his distress,
nor the fury of his rage, ever draw from him an angry word, or upbraiding
expression towards her; but even when, at her instigation, he is about to add
the murder of his friend and late colleague to that of his sovereign, kinsman,
and benefactor, he is chiefly anxious that she should not share the guilt of his
blood:&mdash;'Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck! till thou applaud the
deed.' How much more real grandeur and exaltation of character is displayed
in one such simple expression from the heart, than in all the laboured pomp
of rhetorical amplification."</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>What think you of that, Talboys?</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Why, like much of the cant of criticism, it sounds at once queer and commonplace.
I seem to have heard it before many thousand times, and yet
never to have heard it at all till this moment.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Seward?</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

Payne Knight had never read the tragedy, even with the most ordinary

<p>Cursed nonsense. Beg pardon, sir&mdash;sink cursed&mdash;mere nonsense&mdash;out and

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>How so?</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>A foolish libel on Shakspeare. Was he the man to make the character
of an ungrateful traitor, murderer, usurper, and tyrant, interesting by sublime
flashes of generosity, magnanimity, courage, and tenderness, and&mdash;do I repeat
the words correctly?&mdash;of every exalted quality that can dignify and adorn the
human mind.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Buller&mdash;keep up that face&mdash;you are positively beautiful&mdash;</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>No quizzing&mdash;I am ugly&mdash;but I have a good figure&mdash;look at that leg, sir!</p>

<p>I prefer the other.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>There have been Poets among us who fain would&mdash;if they could&mdash;have so
violated nature; but their fabrications have been felt to be falsehoods&mdash;and
no quackery may resuscitate drowned lies.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Shakspeare nowhere insists on the virtues of Macbeth&mdash;he leaves their measure
indeterminate. That the villain may have had some good points we are
all willing to believe&mdash;few people are without them;&mdash;nor have I any quarrel
with those who believe he had high qualities, and is corrupted by ambition. But
what high qualities had he shown before Shakspeare sets him personally before
us to judge for ourselves? Valour&mdash;courage&mdash;intrepidity&mdash;call it what you
will&mdash;Martial Virtue&mdash;</p>

<p>The "bleeding Serjeant" pursues his panegyric till he grows faint&mdash;and is led
off speechless; others take it up&mdash;and we are thus&mdash;and in other ways&mdash;prepared
to look on Macbeth as a paragon of bravery, loyalty, and patriotism.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>So had seemed Cawdor.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Good. Shakspeare sets Macbeth before us under the most imposing circumstances
of a warlike age; but of his inner character as yet he has told us
nothing&mdash;we are to find that out for ourselves during the Drama. If there
be sublime flashes of generosity, magnanimity, and every exalted virtue, we
have eyes to see, unless indeed blinded by the lightning&mdash;and if the sublime
flashes be frequent, and the struggle of every exalted quality that can adorn
the human mind, though ineffectual, yet strong&mdash;why, then, we must not
only pity and forgive, but admire and love the "traitor, murderer, usurper,
and tyrant," with all the poetical and philosophical fervour of that amiable
enthusiast, Mr Payne Knight.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Somehow or other I cannot help having an affection for Macbeth.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>You had better leave the Tent, sir.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>No. I won't.</p>

<p>NORTH</p>

<p>Give us then, my dear Buller, your Theory of the Thane's character.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>"Theory, God bless you, I have none to give, sir." Warlike valour, as
you said, is marked first and last&mdash;at the opening, and at the end. Surely
a good and great quality, at least for poetical purposes. High general reputation
won and held. The opinion of the wounded soldier was that of the
whole army; and when he himself says, "I have bought golden opinions
from all sorts of people, which would be worn now in their newest gloss, not
thrown aside so soon," I accept that he then truly describes his position in
men's minds.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>All true. But we soon gain, too, this insight into his constitution, that
the pillar upon which he has built up life is Reputation, and not Respect of
Law&mdash;not Self-Respect; that the point which Shakspeare above all others
intends in him, is that his is a spirit not self-stayed&mdash;leaning upon outward
stays&mdash;and therefore&mdash;</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Liable to all&mdash;</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Don't take the words out of my mouth, sir; or rather, don't put them into
my mouth, sir.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Touchy to-day.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>The strongest expression of this character is his throwing himself upon the
illicit divinings of futurity, upon counsellors known for infernal; and you see
what subjugating sway the Three Spirits take at once over him. On the contrary,
the Thaness is self-stayed; and this difference grounds the poetical
opposition of the two personages. In Macbeth, I suppose a certain splendour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[Pg 623]</a></span>
of character&mdash;magnificence of action high&mdash;a certain impure generosity&mdash;mixed
up of some kindliness and sympathy, and of the pleasure from self-elation
and self-expansion in a victorious career, and of that ambition which
feeds on public esteem.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Ay&mdash;just so, sir.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Now mark, Buller&mdash;this is a character which, if the path of duty and the
path of personal ambition were laid out by the Sisters to be one and the same
path, might walk through life in sunlight and honour, and invest the tomb
with proud and revered trophies. To show such a spirit wrecked and hurled
into infamy&mdash;the ill-woven sails rent into shreds by the whirlwind&mdash;is a lesson
worthy the Play and the Poet&mdash;and such a lesson as I think Shakspeare
likely to have designed&mdash;or, without preaching about lessons, such an ethical
revelation as I think likely to have caught hold upon Shakspeare's intelligence.
It would seem to me a dramatically-poetical subject. The mightiest
of temptations occurs to a mind, full of powers, endowed with available moral
elements, but without set virtue&mdash;without principles&mdash;"and down goes all
before it." If the essential delineation of Macbeth be this conflict of Moral
elements&mdash;of good and evil&mdash;of light and darkness&mdash;I see a very poetical conception;
if merely a hardened and bloody hypocrite from the beginning, I see
none. But I need not say to you, gentlemen, that all this is as far as may be
from the exaggerated panegyric on his character by Payne Knight.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Macbeth is a brave man&mdash;so is Banquo&mdash;so are we Four, brave men&mdash;they
in their way and day&mdash;we in ours&mdash;they as Celts and Soldiers&mdash;we as Saxons
and Civilians&mdash;and we had all need to be so&mdash;for hark! in the midst of ours,
"Thunder and Lightning, and enter Three Witches."</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>I cannot say that I understand distinctly their first Confabulation.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>That's a pity. A sensible man like you should understand everything. But
what if Shakspeare himself did not distinctly understand it? There may have
been original errata in the report, as extended by himself from notes taken in
short-hand on the spot&mdash;light bad&mdash;noise worse&mdash;voices of Weird Sisters
worst&mdash;matter obscure&mdash;manner uncouth&mdash;why really, Buller, all things considered,
Shakspeare has shown himself a very pretty Penny-a-liner.</p>

<p>Not unlikely&mdash;attended by his Staff. Generals, on such occasions, usually
ride&mdash;but perhaps Macbeth and Banquo, being in kilts, preferred walking in
their seven-league boots. Thomas Campbell has said, "When the drum of
the Scottish Army is heard on the wild heath, and when I fancy it advancing
with its bowmen in front, and its spears and banners in the distance, I am
always disappointed with Macbeth's entrance at the head of a few kilted
actors." The army may have been there&mdash;but they did not see the Weirds&mdash;nor,
I believe, did the Weirds see them. With Macbeth and Banquo alone
had they to do: we see no Army at that hour&mdash;we hear no drums&mdash;we are
deaf even to the Great Highland Bagpipe, though He, you may be sure, was
not dumb&mdash;all "plaided and plumed in their tartan array" the Highland Host
ceased to be&mdash;like vanished shadows&mdash;at the first apparition of "those so

Men have been disbanded by dusty Death.</p>

<p>I wish to know <i>where</i> and <i>when</i> had been the Fighting? The Norwegian&mdash;one

<p>Seward, speak on subjects you understand. What do you know, sir, of the
value of money <i>in</i> those days in Scotland?</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>But <i>where</i> had been all the Fighting? There would seem to have been two
hurley-burleys.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I see your drift, Seward. <i>Time and Place</i>, through the First Scene of the
First Act, are past finding out. It has been asked&mdash;Was Shakspeare ever
in Scotland? Never. There is not one word in this Tragedy leading a Scotsman
to think so&mdash;many showing he never had that happiness. Let him deal
with our localities according to his own sovereign will and pleasure, as a prevailing
Poet. But let no man point out his dealings with our localities as
proofs of his having such knowledge of them as implies personal acquaintance
with them gained by a longer or shorter visit in Scotland. The Fights at the
beginning seem to be in Fife. The Soldier, there wounded, delivers his relation
at the King's Camp before Forres. He has crawled, in half-an-hour, or
an hour&mdash;or two hours&mdash;say seventy, eighty, or a hundred miles, or more&mdash;crossing
the ridge of the Grampians. Rather smart. I do not know what you
think here of Time; but I think that Space is here pretty well done for. The
<span class="smcap">Time</span> of the Action of Shakspeare's Plays has never yet, so far as I know,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[Pg 625]</a></span>
been, in any one Play, carefully investigated&mdash;never investigated at all; and
I now announce to you Three&mdash;don't mention it&mdash;that I have made discoveries
here that will astound the whole world, and demand a New Criticism of the
entire Shakspearean Drama.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Let us have one now, I beseech you, sir.</p>

<p>Not now.</p>

<p>No sleep in the Tent till we have it, sir. I do dearly love astounding discoveries&mdash;and
at this time of day, in astounding discovery in Shakspeare!
May it not prove a Mare's Nest!</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>The Tragedy of Macbeth is a <i>prodigious</i> Tragedy, because in it the Chariot
of Nemesis <i>visibly</i> rides in the lurid thunder-sky. Because in it the ill motions
of a human soul, which Theologians account for by referring them all to suggestions
of Beelzebub, are expounded in visible, mysterious, tangible, terrible
shape and symbolisation by the Witches. It is great by the character and
person, workings and sufferings, of Lady Macbeth&mdash;by the immense poetical
power in doing the Witches&mdash;mingling for once in the world the Homely-Grotesque
and the Sublime&mdash;extinguishing the Vulgar in the Sublime&mdash;by the
bond, whatsoever it be, between Macbeth and his wife&mdash;by making us tolerate
her and him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Didn't I say that in my own way, sir? And didn't you reprove me for
saying it, and order me out of the Tent?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>And what of the Witches?</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Had you not stopt me. I say now, sir, that nobody understands Shakspeare's
<span class="smcap">Hecate</span>. Who is <span class="smcap">She</span>? Each of the Three Weirds is = one Witch +
one of the Three Fates&mdash;therefore the union of two incompatible natures&mdash;more
than in a Centaur. Oh! Sir! what a hand that was which bound the
two into one&mdash;inseverably! There they are for ever as the Centaurs <i>are</i>.
But the gross Witch prevails; which Shakspeare needed for securing belief,
and he has it, full. Hecate, sir, comes in to balance the disproportion&mdash;she
lifts into Mythology&mdash;and strengthens the mythological tincture. So does the
"Pit of Acheron." That is classical. To the best of my remembrance, no
mention of any such Pit in the Old or New Statistical Account of Scotland.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>And, in the Incantation Scene, those Apparitions! Mysterious, ominous,
picturesque&mdash;and self-willed. They are commanded by the Witches, but
under a limitation. Their oracular power is their own. They are of unknown
orders&mdash;as if for the occasion created in Hell.</p>

<p>North.</p>

<p>Talboys, are you asleep&mdash;or are you at Chess with your eyes shut?</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>At Chess with my eyes shut. I shall send off my move to my friend Stirling
by first post. But my ears were open&mdash;and I ask&mdash;when did Macbeth
first design the murder of Duncan? Does not everybody think&mdash;in the moment
<i>after</i> the Witches have first accosted and left him? Does not&mdash;it may
be asked&mdash;the whole moral significancy of the Witches disappear, unless the
invasion of hell into Macbeth's bosom is first made by their presence and
voices?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>No. The whole moral significancy of the Witches only then appears, when
we are assured that they address themselves only to those who already have
been tampering with their conscience. "Good sir! why do you start, and
seem to fear things that do sound so fair?" That question put to Macbeth by
Banquo turns our eyes to his face&mdash;and we see Guilt. There was no start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[Pg 626]</a></span>
at "Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor,"&mdash;but at the word "King" well might
he start; for &mdash;&mdash; eh?</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>We must look up the Scene.</p>

<p>No need for that. You have it by heart&mdash;recite it.</p>

<p>Attend to that "start" of Macbeth, Talboys.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>He might well start on being told of a sudden, by such seers, that he was
hereafter to be King of Scotland.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>There was more in the start than that, my lad, else Shakspeare would not
have so directed our eyes to it. I say again&mdash;it was the start&mdash;of a murderer.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>And what if I say it was not? But I have the candour to confess, that I
am not familiar with the starts of murderers&mdash;so may possibly be mistaken.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Omit what intervenes&mdash;and give us the Soliloquy, Talboys. But before you
do so, let me merely remind you that Macbeth's mind, from the little he says
in the interim, is manifestly ruminating on something bad, ere he breaks out
into Soliloquy.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"Two truths are told,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Now, my dear Talboys, you will agree with me in thinking that this first
great and pregnant, although brief soliloquy, stands for germ, type, and law
of the whole Play, and of its criticism&mdash;and for clue to the labyrinth of the
Thane's character. "Out of this wood do not desire to go." Out of it I do
not expect soon to go. I regard William as a fair Poet and a reasonable Philosopher;
but as a supereminent Play-wright. The First Soliloquy <i>must</i>
speak the nature of Macbeth, else the Craftsman has no skill in his trade. A
Soliloquy <i>reveals</i>. That is its function. Therein is the soul heard and seen
discoursing with itself&mdash;within itself; and if you carry your eye through&mdash;up
to the First Appearance of Lady Macbeth&mdash;this Soliloquy is distinctly the
highest point of the Tragedy&mdash;the tragic acme&mdash;or dome&mdash;or pinnacle&mdash;therefore
of power indefinite, infinite. On this rock I stand, a Colossus ready to be
thrown down by&mdash;an Earthquake.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Pushed off by&mdash;a shove.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Not by a thousand Buller-power. Can you believe, Buller, that the word
of the Third Witch, "that shalt be <span class="smcap">King</span> Hereafter," <i>sows</i> the murder in
Macbeth's heart, and that it springs up, flowers, and fruits with such fearful
rapidity.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Why&mdash;Yes and No.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Attend, Talboys, to the words "supernatural soliciting." What "supernatural
soliciting" to evil is there here? Not a syllable had the Weird
Sisters breathed about Murder. But now there is much soliloquising&mdash;and
Cawdor contemplates himself <i>objectively</i>&mdash;seen busy upon an elderly gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[Pg 628]</a></span>
called Duncan&mdash;after a fashion that so frightens him <i>subjectively</i>&mdash;that Banquo
cannot help whispering to Rosse and Angus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"See how our partner's rapt!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>"My thought whose murder's yet fantastical." I agree with you, sir, in
suspecting he must have thought of the murder.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>It is from no leaning towards the Weird Sisters&mdash;whom I never set eyes on
but once, and then without interchanging a word, leapt momentarily out of
this world into that pitch-pot of a pond in Glenco&mdash;it is, I say, from no leaning
towards the Weird Sisters that I take this view of Macbeth's character. No
"sublime flashes of generosity, magnanimity, tenderness, and every exalted
quality that can dignify and adorn the human mind," do I ever suffer to pass
by without approbation, when coruscating from the character of any well-disposed
man, real or imaginary, however unaccountable at other times his
conduct may appear to be; but Shakspeare, who knew Macbeth better than
any of us, has here assured us that he was in heart a murderer&mdash;for how long
he does not specify&mdash;before he had ever seen a birse on any of the Weird
Sisters' beards. But let's be canny. Talboys&mdash;pray, what is the meaning of
the word "soliciting," "preternatural soliciting," in this Soliloquy?</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Soliciting, sir, is, in my interpreting, "an appealing, intimate visitation."</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Right. The appeal is general&mdash;as that <i>challenge</i> of a trumpet&mdash;<i>Fairy Queen</i>,
book III., canto xii., stanza 1&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Signe of nigh battail or got victorye"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which, all indeterminate, is notwithstanding <i>a challenge</i>&mdash;operates, and is felt
as such.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>So a thundering knock at your door&mdash;which may be a friend or an enemy.
It comes as a summoning. It is more than internal urging and inciting of me
by my own thoughts&mdash;for mark, sir, the rigour of the word "supernatural,"
which throws the soliciting off his own soul upon the Weirds. The
word is really undetermined to pleasure or pain&mdash;the essential thought being
that there is a searching or penetrating provocative&mdash;a stirring up of that
which lay dead and still. Next is the debate whether this intrusive, and pungent,
and stimulant assault of a presence and an oracle be good or ill?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Does the hope live in him for a moment that this home-visiting is not ill&mdash;that
the Spirits are not ill? They have spoken truth so far&mdash;ergo, the Third
"All hail!" shall be true, too. But more than that&mdash;they have spoken <i>truth</i>.
Ergo, they are not spirits of Evil. That hope dies in the same instant, submerged
in the stormy waves which the blast from hell arouses. The infernal
revelation glares clear before him&mdash;a Crown held out by the hand of Murder.
One or two struggles occur. Then the truth stands before him fixed and
immutable&mdash;"Evil, be thou my good." He is dedicated: and passive to fate.
I cannot comprehend this so feeble debate in the mind of a good man&mdash;I cannot
comprehend any such debate at all in the mind of a previously settled and
determined murderer; but I can comprehend and feel its awful significancy
in the mind of a man already in a most perilous moral condition.</p>

gunpowder.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>May we not say, then, that perhaps the Witches have shown no more than
this&mdash;the Fascination of Contact between Passion and Opportunity?</p>

<p>To Philosophy reading the hieroglyphic; but to the People what? To them

</div></div>

<p>The contagion of their presence, in spite of what we have been saying, almost
reconciles my understanding to what it would otherwise revolt from, the <i>suddenness</i>
with which the penetration of Macbeth into futurity lays fast hold upon
Murder.</p>

<p>Lady Macbeth herself corroborates your judgment and Shakspeare's on her
husband's character.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Does she?</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>She does. In that dreadful parley between them on the night of the Murder&mdash;she

<p>This&mdash;mark you, sir&mdash;must have been before the Play began!</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I have often thought of the words&mdash;and Shakspeare himself has so adjusted
the action of the Play as that, <i>since the encounter with the Weirds</i>, no opportunity
had occurred to Macbeth for the "making of time and place." Therefore
it must, as you say, have been <i>before it</i>. Buller, what say you now?</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Gagged.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>True, she speaks of his being "full of the milk of human kindness." The
words have become favourites with us, who are an affectionate and domestic
people&mdash;and are lovingly applied to the loving; but Lady Macbeth attached
no such profound sense to them as we do; and meant merely that she thought
her husband would, after all, much prefer greatness unbought by blood; and,
at the time she referred to, it is probable he would; but that she meant no
more than that, is plain from the continuation of her praise, in which her ideas
get not a little confused; and her words, interpret them as you will, leave
nothing "milky" in Macbeth at all. Milk of human kindness, indeed!</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Won't you believe a Wife to be a good judge of her Husband's disposition?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Not Lady Macbeth. For does not she herself tell us, at the same time,
that he had formerly schemed how to commit Murder?</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Gagged again.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I see no reason for doubting that she was attached to her husband; and
Shakspeare loved to put into the lips of women beautiful expressions of love&mdash;but
he did not intend that we should be deceived thereby in our moral judgements.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Did this ever occur to you, sir? Macbeth, when hiring the murderers who
are to look after Banquo and Fleance, cites a conversation in which he had
demonstrated to them that the oppression under which they had long suffered,
and which they had supposed to proceed from Macbeth, proceeded really from
Banquo? My firm belief is that it proceeded from Macbeth&mdash;that their suspicion
was right&mdash;that Macbeth is misleading them&mdash;and that Shakspeare means
you to apprehend this. But why should Macbeth have oppressed his inferiors,
unless he had been&mdash;long since&mdash;of a tyrannical nature? He oppresses his
inferiors&mdash;they are sickened and angered with the world&mdash;by his oppression&mdash;he
tells them 'twas not he but another who had oppressed them&mdash;and that
other&mdash;at his instigation&mdash;they willingly murder. An ugly affair altogether.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Very. But let us keep to the First Act&mdash;and see what a hypocrite Macbeth
has so very soon become&mdash;what a savage assassin! He has just followed
up his Soliloquy with these significant lines&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, this Milk of Human Kindness is off at a hand-gallop to Inverness.
The King has announced a Royal Visit to Macbeth's own Castle. But Cawdor
had before this despatched a letter to his lady, from which Shakspeare has given
us an extract. And then, as I understand it, a special messenger besides,
to say "the King comes here to-night." Which of the two is the more
impatient to be at work 'tis hard to say; but the idea of the murder originated
with the male Prisoner. We have his wife's word for it&mdash;she told him
so to his face&mdash;and he did not deny it. We have his own word for it&mdash;he
told himself so to his own face&mdash;and he never denies it at any time during the
play.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>You said, a little while ago, sir, that you believed Macbeth and his wife
were a happy couple.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Not I. I said she was attached to him&mdash;and I say now that the wise men
are not of the Seven, who point to her reception of her husband, on his arrival
at <i>home</i>, as a proof of her want of affection. They seem to think she ought
to have rushed into his arms&mdash;slobbered upon his shoulder&mdash;and so forth. For
had he not been at the Wars? Pshaw! The most tender-hearted Thanesses
of those days&mdash;even those that kept albums&mdash;would have been ashamed of
weeping on sending their Thanes off to battle&mdash;much more on receiving them
back in a sound skin&mdash;with new honours nodding on their plumes. Lady Macbeth
was not one of the turtle-doves&mdash;fit mate she for the King of the Vultures.
I am too good an ornithologist to call them Eagles. She received her
mate fittingly&mdash;with murder in her soul; but more cruel&mdash;more selfish than
he, she could not be&mdash;nor, perhaps, was she less; but she was more resolute&mdash;and
resolution even in evil&mdash;in such circumstances as hers&mdash;seems to
argue a superior nature to his, who, while he keeps vacillating, as if it were
between good and evil, betrays all the time the bias that is surely inclining
him to evil, into which he makes a sudden and sure wheel at last.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>It would, I fear, be wrong to say so. But I was speaking of Macbeth's
character&mdash;not of hers&mdash;and, in comparison with him, she may seem a great
creature. They are now utterly alone&mdash;and of the two he has been the more
familiar with murder. Between them, Duncan already is a dead man. But
how pitiful&mdash;at such a time and at such a greeting&mdash;Macbeth's cautions&mdash;</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Poor devil! Macbeth a poor devil?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Why, Buller, does not the poor devil?</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Poor devil! Macbeth a poor devil?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Why, Seward, does not the poor devil&mdash;</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Speak up&mdash;speak out? Is he afraid of the spiders? You know him, sir&mdash;you
see through him.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Ay, Seward&mdash;reserved and close as he is&mdash;he wants nerve&mdash;<i>pluck</i>&mdash;he is
close upon the coward&mdash;and that would be well, were there the slightest
tendency towards change of purpose in the Pale Face; but there is none&mdash;he
is as cruel as ever&mdash;the more close the more cruel&mdash;the more irresolute the
more murderous&mdash;for to murder he is sure to come. Seward, you said
well&mdash;why does not the poor devil speak up&mdash;speak out? Is he afraid of the
spiders?</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Murderous-looking villain&mdash;no need of words.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I did not say, sir, there was any need of words. Why, will you always be
contradicting one?</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Me? I? I hope I shall never live to see the day on which I contradict
Christopher North in his own Tent. At least&mdash;rudely.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Do it rudely&mdash;not as you did now&mdash;and often do&mdash;as if you were agreeing
with me&mdash;but you are incurable. I say, my dear Talboys, that Macbeth so
bold in a "twa-haun'd crack" with himself in a Soliloquy&mdash;so figurative&mdash;and
so fond of swearing by the Stars and old Mother Night, who were not aware
of his existence&mdash;should not have been thus tongue-tied to his own wife in
their own secretest chamber&mdash;should have unlocked and flung open the door
of his heart to her&mdash;like a Man. I blush for him&mdash;I do. So did his wife.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>I don't find that in the record.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Don't you? "Your face, my Thane, is as a book where men may read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[Pg 633]</a></span>
strange matters." She sees in his face self-alarm at his own murderous intentions.
And so she counsels him about his face&mdash;like a self-collected, trustworthy
woman. "To beguile the time, look like the time;" with further good
stern advice. But&mdash;"We shall speak farther," is all she can get from him in
answer to conjugal assurances that should have given him a palpitation at the
heart, and set his eyes on fire&mdash;</p>

<p>There spoke one worthy to be a Queen!</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Worthy!</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Ay&mdash;in that age&mdash;in that country. 'Twas not then the custom "to speak
daggers but use none." Did Shakspeare mean to dignify, to magnify Macbeth
by such demeanour? No&mdash;to degrade and minimise the murderer.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>My dear sir, I cordially agree with every word you utter. Go on&mdash;my dear
sir&mdash;to instruct&mdash;to illumine&mdash;</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>To bring out "sublime flashes of magnanimity, courage, tenderness," in
Macbeth&mdash;</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>"Of every exalted quality that can dignify and adorn the human mind"&mdash;the
mind of Macbeth in his struggle with the allurements of ambition!</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Observe, how this reticence&mdash;on the part of Macbeth&mdash;contrasted with his
wife's eagerness and exultation, makes her, for the moment, seem the
wickeder of the two&mdash;the fiercer and the more cruel. For the moment only;
for we soon ask ourselves what means this un-husbandly reserve in him who
had sent her <i>that letter</i>&mdash;and then a messenger to tell her the king was coming&mdash;and
who had sworn to himself as savagely as she now does, not to let slip
this opportunity of cutting his king's throat. He is well-pleased to see that
his wife is as bloody-minded as himself&mdash;that she will not only give all necessary
assistance&mdash;as an associate&mdash;but concert the when, and the where, and
the how&mdash;and if need be, with her own hand deal the blow.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>She did not then know that Macbeth had made up his mind to murder
Duncan that very night. <i>But we know it.</i> She has instantly made up hers&mdash;we
know how; but being as yet unassured of her husband, she welcomes
him home with a Declaration that must have more than answered his fondest
hopes; and, therefore, he is almost mute&mdash;the few words he does utter seem
to indicate no settled purpose&mdash;Duncan may fulfil his intention of going in the
morning, or he may not; but we know that the silence of the murderer now
is because the murderess is manifestly all he could wish&mdash;and that, had she
shown any reluctance, he would have resumed his eloquence, and, to convert
her to his way of thinking, argued as powerfully as he did when converting
himself.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>You carry on at such a pace, sir, there's no keeping up with you. Pull up,
that I may ask you a very simple question. On his arrival at his castle,
Macbeth finds his wife reading a letter from her amiable spouse, about the
Weird Sisters. Pray, when was that letter written?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>At what hour precisely? That I can't say. It must, however, have been
written before Macbeth had been presented to the King&mdash;for there is no allusion
in it to the King's intention to visit their Castle. I believe it to have been
written about an hour or so after the prophecy of the Weirds&mdash;either in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[Pg 634]</a></span>
place of refreshment by the roadside&mdash;or in such a Tent as this&mdash;kept ready
for the General in the King's Camp at Forres. He despatched it by a Gilly&mdash;a
fast one like your Cornwall Clipper&mdash;and then tumbled in.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>When did she receive it?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Early next morning.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>How could that be, since she is reading it, as her husband steps in, well on,
as I take it, in the afternoon?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Buller, you are a blockhead. There had she, for many hours, been sitting,
and walking <i>about</i> with it, now rumpled up in her fist&mdash;now crunkled up
between her breasts&mdash;now locked up in a safe&mdash;now spread out like a sampler
on that tasty little oak table&mdash;and sometimes she might have been heard by
the servants&mdash;had they had the unusual curiosity to listen at the door&mdash;murmuring
like a stock-dove&mdash;anon hooting like an owl&mdash;by-and-by barking like
an eagle&mdash;then bellowing liker a hart than a hind&mdash;almost howling like a wolf&mdash;and
why not?&mdash;now singing a snatch of an old Gaelic air, with a clear,
wild, sweet voice, like that of "a human!"</p>

<p>It <i>is</i> grand indeed. But, my dear Buller, was that all she had said to herself,
think you? No&mdash;no&mdash;no. But it was all Shakspeare had time for on
the Stage. Oh, sirs! The Time of the Stage is but a simulacrum of true
Time. That must be done at one stroke, on the Stage, which in a Life takes
ten. The Stage persuades <i>that</i> in one conversation, or soliloquy, which Life
may do in twenty&mdash;you have not leisure or good-will for the ambages and
iterations of the Real.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>So in Poetry. You take little for much. You need not wonder, then, that
on an attendant entering and saying, "The King comes here to-night," she
cries, "Thou'rt mad to say it!" Had you happened to tell her so half-an-hour
ago, who knows but that she might have received it with a stately smile,
that hardly moved a muscle on her high-featured front, and gave a merciful
look to her green eyes even when she was communing with Murder!</p>

</div></div>

<p>Ay&mdash;where's the Thane of Cawdor? Why did not Shakspeare show him to
us, sitting at supper with the King?</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Did he sup with the King?</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>I believe he sat down&mdash;but got up again&mdash;and left the Chamber.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>His wife seeks him out. "He has almost supped. Why have you left the
Chamber?" "Has he asked for me?" "Know ye not he has?"</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>On Macbeth's Soliloquy, which his wife's entrance here interrupts, how
much inconsiderate comment have not moralists made! Here&mdash;they have
said&mdash;is the struggle of a good man with temptation. Hearken, say they&mdash;to
the voice of Conscience! What does the good man, in this hour of trial,
say to himself? He says to himself&mdash;"I have made up my mind to
assassinate my benefactor in my own house&mdash;the only doubt I have, is about
the consequences to myself in the world to come." Well, then&mdash;"We'd
jump the world to come. But if I murder him&mdash;may not others murder me?
Retribution even in this world." Call you that the voice of Conscience?</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Hardly.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>He then goes on to descant to himself about the relation in which he stands
to Duncan, and apparently discovers for the first time, that "he's here in
double trust;" and that as his host, his kinsman, and his subject, he should
"against his murderer shut the door, not bear the knife myself."</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>A man of genius.</p>

<p>Besides, Duncan is not only a King, but a good King&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>That is much better morality&mdash;keep there, Macbeth&mdash;or thereabouts&mdash;and
Duncan's life is tolerably safe&mdash;at least for one night. But Shakspeare knew
his man&mdash;and what manner of man he is we hear in the unbearable context,

the true and the false.</p>

<span class="i0">That tears shall drown the wind."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Cant and fustian. Shakspeare knew that cant and fustian would come at
that moment from the mouth of Macbeth. Accordingly, he offers but a poor
resistance to the rhetoric that comes rushing from his wife's heart&mdash;even that
sentiment which is thought so fine&mdash;and 'tis well enough in its way&mdash;</p>

<p>Shakspeare does not paint here a grand and desperate struggle between good
and evil thoughts in Macbeth's mind&mdash;but a mock fight; had there been any
deep sincerity in the feeling expressed in the bombast&mdash;had there been any
true feeling at all&mdash;it would have revived and deepened&mdash;not faded and died

</div></div>

<p>That is my idea of the Soliloquy. Think on it.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>The best critics tell us that Shakspeare's Lady Macbeth has a commanding
Intellect. Certes she has a commanding Will. I do not see what a commanding
Intellect has to do in a Tragedy of this kind&mdash;or what opportunity
she has of showing it. Do you, sir?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I do not.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Her Intellect seems pretty much on a par with Macbeth's in the planning
of the murder.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I defy any human Intellect to devise well an atrocious Murder. Pray, how
would you have murdered Duncan?</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Ask me rather how I would&mdash;this night&mdash;murder Christopher North.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>No more of that&mdash;no dallying in that direction. You make me shudder.
Shakspeare knew that a circumspect murder is an impossibility&mdash;that a murder
of a King in the murderer's own house, with expectation of non-discovery,
is the irrationality of infatuation. The poor Idiot chuckles at the poor Fury's
device as at once original and plausible&mdash;and, next hour, what single soul in
the Castle does not know who did the deed?</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>High Intellect indeed!</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>The original murder is bad to the uttermost. I mean badly contrived. What
colour was there in colouring the two Grooms? No two men kill their master,
and then go to bed again in his room with bloody faces and poignards.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>If this was really a very bad plot altogether, it is her Ladyship's as much&mdash;far
more than his Lordship's. Against whom, then, do we conclude? Her?
I think not&mdash;but the Poet. <i>He</i> is the badly-contriving assassin. He does
not intend lowering your esteem for her Ladyship's talents. Am I, sir, to
think that William himself, after the same game, would have hunted no better?
I believe he would; but he thinks that this will carry the Plot through
for the Stage well enough. The House, seeing and hearing, will not stay to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[Pg 637]</a></span>
criticise. The Horror persuades Belief. He knew the whole mystery of
murder.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>My dear Buller, wheel nearer me. I would not lose a word you say.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Did Macbeth commit an error in killing the two Grooms? And does his
Lady think so?</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>A gross error, and his Lady thinks so.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Why was it a gross error&mdash;and why did his lady think so?</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Because&mdash;why&mdash;I really can't tell.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Nor I. The question leads to formidable difficulties&mdash;either way. But
answer me this. Is her swooning at the close of her husband's most graphic
picture of the position of the corpses&mdash;real or pretended?</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Real.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Pretended.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Sir?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I reserve my opinion.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Not a faint&mdash;but a <i>feint</i>. She cannot undo that which is done; nor hinder
that which he will do next. She must mind her own business. Now distinctly
her own business is&mdash;to faint. A high-bred, sensitive, innocent Lady,
startled from her sleep to find her guest and King murdered, and the room full
of aghast nobles, cannot possibly do anything else but faint. Lady Macbeth,
who "all particulars of duty knows," faints accordingly.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Seward, we are ready to hear you.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>She has been about a business that must have somewhat shook her nerves&mdash;granting
them to be of iron. She would herself have murdered Duncan had
he not resembled her Father as he slept; and on sudden discernment of that
dreadful resemblance, her soul must have shuddered, if her body served her
to stagger away from parricide. On the deed being done, she is terrified after
a different manner from the doer of the deed; but her terror is as great; and
though she says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"The sleeping and the dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are but as pictures&mdash;'tis the eye of childhood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fears a painted Devil&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>believe me that her face was like ashes, as she returned to the chamber to
gild the faces of the grooms with the dead man's blood. That knocking, too,
alarmed the Lady&mdash;believe me&mdash;as much as her husband; and to keep cool
and collected before him, so as to be able to support him at that moment with
her advice, must have tried the utmost strength of her nature. Call her Fiend&mdash;she
was Woman. Down stairs she comes&mdash;and stands among them all, at
first like one alarmed only&mdash;astounded by what she hears&mdash;and striving to
simulate the ignorance of the innocent&mdash;"What, in our house?" "Too
cruel anywhere!" What she must have suffered then, Shakspeare lets us
conceive for ourselves; and what on her husband's elaborate description of
his inconsiderate additional murders. "The whole is too much for her"&mdash;she
"is perplexed in the extreme"&mdash;and the sinner swoons.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Seward suggests a bold, strong, deep, tragical turn of the scene&mdash;that she
faints actually. Well&mdash;so be it. I shall say, first, that I think it a weakness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[Pg 638]</a></span>
in my favourite; but I will go so far as to add that I can let it pass for a not
unpardonable weakness&mdash;the occasion given. But I must deal otherwise with
her biographer. Him I shall hold to a strict rendering of account. I will
know of him what he is about, and what she is about. If she faints really,
and against her will, having forcible reasons for holding her will clear, she
must be shown fighting to the last effort of will, against the assault of womanly
nature, and drop, vanquished, as one dead, without a sound. But the Thaness
calls out lustily&mdash;she remembers, "as we shall make our griefs and clamours
roar upon his death." She makes noise enough&mdash;takes good care to attract
everybody's attention to her performance&mdash;for which I commend her. Calculate
as nicely as you will&mdash;she distracts or diverts speculation, and makes an
interesting and agreeable break in the conversation.&mdash;I think that the obvious
meaning is the right meaning&mdash;and <i>that she faints on purpose</i>.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Decided in favour of Feint.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>You might have had the good manners to ask for <i>my</i> opinion.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I beg a thousand pardons, Buller.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>A hundred will do, North. In Davies' <i>Anecdotes of the Stage</i>, I remember
reading that Garrick would not trust Mrs Pritchard with the Swoon&mdash;and that
Macklin thought Mrs Porter alone could have been endured by the audience.
Therefore, by the Great Manager, Lady Macbeth was not allowed in the
Scene to appear at all. His belief was, that with her Ladyship it was a feint&mdash;and
that the Gods, aware of that, unless restrained by profound respect for the
actress, would have <i>laughed</i>&mdash;as at something rather comic. If the Gods, in
Shakspeare's days, were as the Gods in Garrick's, William, methinks, would
not, on any account, have exposed the Lady to derision at such a time. But
I suspect the Gods of the Globe would not have laughed, whatever they might
have thought of her sincerity, and that she did appear before them in a Scene
from which nothing could account for her absence. She was not, I verily believe,
given to fainting&mdash;perhaps this was the first time she had ever fainted
since she was a girl. <i>Now</i> I believe she did. She would have stood by her
husband at all hazards, had she been able, both on his account and her own; she
would not have so deserted him at such a critical juncture; her character was
of boldness rather than duplicity; her business now&mdash;her duty&mdash;was to brazen
it out; but she grew sick&mdash;qualms of conscience, however terrible, can be

<p>Nor, with all submission, my dear Sir, can I think you treat your favourite
murderess, on this trying occasion, with your usual fairness and candour. All
she says, is, "Help me hence, ho!" Macduff says, "Look to the Lady"&mdash;and
Banquo says, "Look to the Lady"&mdash;and she is "carried off." Some critic or
other&mdash;I think Malone&mdash;says that Macbeth shows he knows "'tis a feint" by
not going to her assistance. Perhaps he was mistaken&mdash;know it he could not.
And nothing more likely to make a woman faint than that revelling and
wallowing of his in that bloody description.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Claudius, the Uncle-king in Hamlet, is perhaps the most odious character
in all Shakspeare. But he does no unnecessary murders. He has killed the
Father, and will the Son, all in regular order. But Macbeth plunges himself,
like a drunken man, into unnecessary and injurious cruelties. He throws like
a reckless gamester. If I am to own the truth, I don't know why he is so
cruel. I don't think that he takes any pleasure in mere cruelty, like
Nero&mdash;</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>What do we know of Nero? Was he mad?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I don't think that he takes any pleasure in mere cruelty, like Nero; but he
seems to be under some infatuation that drags or drives him along. To kill is,
in every difficulty, the ready resource that occurs to him&mdash;as if to go on murdering
were, by some law of the Universe, the penalty which you must pay for
having once murdered.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>I think, Sir, that without contradicting anything we said before Lunch
about his Lordship or his Kingship, we may conceive in the natural Macbeth
considerable force of Moral Intuition.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>We may.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Of Moral Intelligence?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Of Moral Obedience?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Moral Intuition, and Moral Intelligence breaking out, from time to time,
all through&mdash;we understand how there is engendered in him strong self-dissatisfaction&mdash;thence
perpetual goadings on&mdash;and desperate attempts to lose
conscience in more and more crime.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Ay&mdash;Seward&mdash;even so. He tells you that he stakes soul and body upon
the throw for a Crown. He has got the Crown&mdash;and <i>paid for it</i>. He <i>must</i>
keep it&mdash;else he has bartered soul and body&mdash;for nothing! To make his first
crime <i>good</i>&mdash;he strides gigantically along the road of which it opened the
gate.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>An almost morbid impressibility of imagination is energetically stamped,
and universally recognised in the Thane, and I think, sir, that it warrants,
to a certain extent, a <i>sincerity</i> of the mental movements. He really sees a fantastical
dagger&mdash;he really hears fantastical voices&mdash;perhaps he really sees a
fantastical Ghost. All this in him is Nature&mdash;not artifice&mdash;and a nature
deeply, terribly, tempestuously commoved by the near contact of a murder imminent&mdash;doing&mdash;done.
It is more like a murderer a-making than a murderer
made.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>See, sir, how precisely this characteristic is proposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[Pg 640]</a></span></p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>By whom?</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>By Shakspeare, in that first Soliloquy. The poetry colouring, throughout,
his discourse, is its natural efflorescence.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Talboys, Seward, you have spoken well.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>And I have spoken ill?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I have not said so.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>We have all Four of us spoken well&mdash;we have all Four of us spoken ill&mdash;and
we have all Four of us spoken but so-so&mdash;now and heretofore&mdash;in this
Tent&mdash;hang the wind&mdash;there's no hearing twelve words in ten a body says.
Honoured sir, I beg permission to say that I cannot admit the Canon laid
down by your Reverence, an hour or two ago, or a minute or two ago, that
Macbeth's extravagant language is designed by Shakspeare to designate hypocrisy.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>You commended Talboys and Seward for noticing the imaginative&mdash;the
poetical character of Macbeth's mind. There we find the reason of his extravagant
language. It may, as you said, be cant and fustian&mdash;or it may not&mdash;but
why attribute to hypocrisy&mdash;as you did&mdash;what may have flowed from his
genius? Poets may rant as loud as he, and yet be honest men. "In a fine
frenzy rolling," their eyes may fasten on fustian.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Good&mdash;go on. Deduct.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Besides, sir, the Stage had such a language of its own; and I cannot help
thinking that Shakspeare often, and too frankly, gave in to it.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>He did.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>I would, however, much rather believe that if Shakspeare meant anything by
it in Macbeth's Oratory or Poetry, he intended thereby rather to impress on us
that last noticed constituent of his nature&mdash;a vehement seizure of imagination.
I believe, sir, that in the hortatory scene Lady Macbeth really vanquishes&mdash;as
the scene ostensibly shows&mdash;his <i>ir</i>resolution. And if Shakspeare means
<i>ir</i>resolution, I do not know why the <i>grounds</i> thereof which Shakspeare assigns
to Macbeth should not be accepted as the true grounds. The Dramatist would
seem to me to demand too much of me, if, <i>under</i> the grounds which he expresses,
he requires me to discard these, and to discover and express others.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>I do not know, sir, if that horrible Invocation of <i>hers</i> to the Spirits of Murder
to unsex her, be held by many to imply that she has no need of their help?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>It is held by many to prove that she was not a woman but a fiend. It
proves the reverse. I infer from it that she does need their help&mdash;and, what
is more, <i>that she gets it</i>. Nothing so dreadful, in the whole range of Man's
Tragic Drama, as that Murder. But I see Seward is growing pale&mdash;we know
his infirmity&mdash;and for the present shun it.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I may, however, ask a question about Banquo's Ghost.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Well&mdash;well&mdash;do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[Pg 641]</a></span></p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>You put the question to me, sir? I am inclined to think, sir, that no real
Ghost sits on the Stool&mdash;but that Shakspeare meant it as with the Daggers.
On the Stage he appears&mdash;that is an abuse.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Not so sure of that, Talboys.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Had Macbeth himself continued to believe that the first-seen Ghost was a
real Ghost, he would not, could not have ventured so soon after its disappearance
to say again, "And to our dear friend Banquo." He does say it&mdash;and
then again diseased imagination assails him at the rash words. Lady Macbeth
reasons with him again, and he finally is persuaded that the Ghost, both times,
had been but brain-sick creations.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"My strange and self-abuse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the initiate fear, that wants hard use:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am but young in deed."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>That certainly looks as if he did then know he had been deceived. But
perhaps he only censures himself for being too much agitated by a real ghost.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>That won't do.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>But go back, my dear Talboys, to the first enacting of the Play. What
could the audience have understood to be happening, without other direction
of their thoughts than the terrified Macbeth's bewildered words? He
never mentions Banquo's name&mdash;and recollect that nobody sitting there then
knew that Banquo had been murdered. The dagger is not in point. Then
the spectators heard him say, "Is this a dagger that I see before me?" And
if no dagger was there, they could at once see that 'twas phantasy.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Something in that.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>A settler.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I entirely separate the two questions&mdash;first, how did the Manager of the
Globe Theatre have the King's Seat at the Feast filled; and second, what
does the highest poetical Canon deliver. I speak now, but to the first. Now,
here the rule is&mdash;"the audience <i>must understand, and at once</i>, what that which
they see and hear means"&mdash;that Rule must govern the art of the drama in
the Manager's practice. You allow that, Talboys?</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>I do.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Rash&mdash;Talboys&mdash;rash: he's getting you into a net.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>That is not my way, Buller. Well, then, suppose Macbeth acted for the
first time to an audience, who are to establish it for a stock-play or to <i>damn
it</i>. Would the Manager commit the whole power of a scene which is perhaps
the most&mdash;singly&mdash;effective of the whole Play&mdash;</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>No&mdash;no&mdash;not the most effective of the whole Play&mdash;</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>The rival, then, of the Murder Scene&mdash;the Sleep-Walking stands aloof and
aloft&mdash;to the chance of a true divination by the whole Globe audience?
I think not. The argument is of a vulgar tone, I confess, and extremely literal,
but it is after the measure of my poor faculties.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>In confirmation of what you say, sir, it has been lately asserted that one of
the two appearings at least is not Banquo's&mdash;but Duncan's. How is that to
be settled but by a real Ghost&mdash;or Ghosts?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[Pg 642]</a></span></p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>And I ask, what has Shakspeare himself undeniably done elsewhere? In
Henry VIII., Queen Katherine sleeps and <i>dreams</i>. Her Dream enters, and
performs various acts&mdash;somewhat expressive&mdash;minutely contrived and prescribed.
It is a mute Dream, which she with shut eyes sees&mdash;which you in
pit, boxes, and gallery see&mdash;which her attendants, watching about her upon
the stage, do <i>not</i> see.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>And in Richard III&mdash;He dreams, and so does Richmond. Eight Ghosts
rise in succession and <i>speak</i> to Richard first, and to the Earl next&mdash;each
hears, I suppose, what concerns himself&mdash;they seem to be present in the two
Tents at once.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>In Cymbeline, Posthumus dreams. His Dream enters&mdash;Ghosts and even
<span class="smcap">Jupiter</span>! They act and speak; and this Dream has a reality&mdash;for Jupiter
hands or tosses a parchment-roll to one of the Ghosts, who lays it, as bidden,
on the breast of the Dreamer, where he, on awaking, perceives it! I call all
this physically strong, sir, for the representation of the metaphysically
thought.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>If Buller may speak, Buller would observe, that once or twice both Ariel
and Prospero come forward "invisible." And in Spenser, the Dream of which
Morpheus lends the use to Archimago, is&mdash;carried.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>We all remember the Dream which Jupiter sends to Agamemnon, and which,
while standing at his bed's-head, puts on the shape of Nestor and speaks;&mdash;the
Ghost of Patroclus&mdash;the actual Ghost which stands at the bed's-head
of Achilles, and <i>is</i> his Dream.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>My friends, Poetry gives a body to the bodiless. The Stage of Shakspeare
was rude, and gross. In my boyhood, I saw the Ghosts appear to John
Kemble in Richard III. Now they may be abolished with Banquo. So may
be Queen Katherine's Angels. But Shakspeare and his Audience had no difficulty
about one person's seeing what another does not&mdash;or one's <i>not</i> seeing,
rather, that which another does. Nor had Homer, when Achilles alone, in the
Quarrel Scene, sees Minerva. Shakspeare and his Audience had no difficulty
about the bodily representation of Thoughts&mdash;the inward by the outward.
Shakspeare and the Great Old Poets leave vague, shadowy, mist-shrouded,
and indeterminate the boundaries between the Thought and the Existent&mdash;the
Real and the Unreal. I am able to believe with you, Talboys, that
Banquo's Ghost was understood by Shakspeare, the Poet, to be the Phantasm
of the murderer's guilt-and-fear-shaken soul; but was required by Shakspeare,
the Manager of the Globe Theatre, to rise up through a trap-door, mealy-faced
and blood-boultered, and so make "the Table full."</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Seward, do bid him speak of Lady Macbeth.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Oblige me, sir&mdash;don't now&mdash;after dinner, if you will.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I shall merely allude now, as exceedingly poetical treatment, to the discretion
throughout used in the <span class="smcap">SHOWING</span> of Lady Macbeth. You might almost
say that she never takes a step on the stage, that does not <i>thrill the Theatre</i>.
Not a waste word, gesture, or look. All at the studied fulness of sublime
tragical power&mdash;yet all wonderfully tempered and governed. I doubt if
Shakspeare could have given a good account of everything that he makes
Macbeth say&mdash;but of all that She says he could.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>As far as I am able to judge, she but once in the whole Play loses her perfect
self-mastery&mdash;when the servant surprises her by announcing the King's
coming. She answers, 'thou'rt mad to say it;' which is a manner of speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[Pg 643]</a></span>
used by those who cannot, or can hardly believe tidings that fill them with
exceeding joy. It is not the manner of a Lady to her servant who unexpectedly
announces the arrival of a high&mdash;of the highest visitor. She recovers
herself instantly. 'Is not thy master with him, who, wer't so, would have
informed for preparation?' This is a turn colouring her exclamation, and is
spoken in the most self-possessed, argumentative, demonstrative tone. The
preceding words had been torn from her; now she has passed, with inimitable
dexterity, from the dreamed Queen, to the usual mistress of her household&mdash;<i>to
the huswife</i>.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>In the Fourth Act&mdash;she is not seen at all. But in the Fifth, lo! and behold!
and at once we know why she had been absent&mdash;we see and are turned
to living stone by the revelation of the terrible truth. I am always inclined
to conceive Lady Macbeth's night-walking as the summit, or topmost
peak of all tragic conception and execution&mdash;in Prose, too, the crowning
of Poetry! But it must be, because these are the <i>ipsissima verba</i>&mdash;yea,
the escaping sighs and moans of the bared soul. There must be nothing,
not even the thin and translucent veil of the verse, betwixt her soul showing
itself, and yours beholding. Words which your "hearing latches"
from the threefold abyss of Night, Sleep, and Conscience! What place for the
enchantment of any music is here? Besides, she speaks in a whisper. The
Siddons did&mdash;audible distinctly, throughout the stilled immense theatre. Here
music is not&mdash;sound is not&mdash;only an anguished soul's faint breathings&mdash;gaspings.
And observe that Lady Macbeth carries&mdash;a candle&mdash;besides washing
her hands&mdash;and besides speaking prose&mdash;three departures from the severe and
elect method, to bring out that supreme revelation. I have been told that
the great Mrs Pritchard used to touch the palm with the tips of her fingers,
for the washing, keeping candle in hand;&mdash;that the Siddons first set down her
candle, that she might come forwards, and wash her hands in earnest, one
over the other, as if she were at her wash-hand stand, with plenty of water in
her basin&mdash;that when Sheridan got intelligence of her design so to do, he ran
shrieking to her, and, with tears in his eyes, besought that she would not, at
one stroke, overthrow Drury Lane&mdash;that she persisted, and turned the thousands
of bosoms to marble.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Our dear, dear Master.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>You will remember, my friends, her <i>four rhymed lines</i>&mdash;uttered to herself in
Act Third. They are very remarkable&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nought's had, all's spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where our desire is got without content:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis safer to be that which we destroy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than, by destruction, dwell in doubtful joy."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They are her only <i>waking</i> acknowledgments of having <i>mis</i>taken life! So&mdash;they
forebode the Sleep-Walking, and the Death&mdash;as an owl, or a raven, or
vulture, or any fowl of obscene wing, might flit between the sun and a
crowned but doomed head&mdash;the shadow but of a moment, yet ominous, for
the augur, of an entire fatal catastrophe.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>They do. But to say the truth, I had either forgot them, or never discovered
their significancy. O that William Shakspeare!</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>O that Christopher North!</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Speak so, friends&mdash;'tis absurd, but I like it.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>It is sincere.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>At last they call him "black Macbeth," and "this dead Butcher." And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[Pg 644]</a></span>
with good reason. They also call her "his fiend-like Queen," which last
expression I regard as highly offensive.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>And they call her so not without strong reason.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>A bold, bad woman&mdash;not a Fiend. I ask&mdash;Did she, or did she not, "with
violent hand foredo her life?" They mention it as a rumour. The Doctor
desires that all means of self-harm may be kept out of her way. Yet the impression
on us, as the thing proceeds, is, that she dies of pure remorse&mdash;which
I believe. She is <i>visibly dying</i>. The cry of women, announcing her
death, is rather as of those who stood around the bed watching, and when the
heart at the touch of the invisible finger stops, shriek&mdash;than of one after the
other coming in and finding the self-slain&mdash;a confused, informal, perplexing,
and perplexed proceeding&mdash;but the Cry of Women is formal, regular for the
stated occasion. You may say, indeed, that she poisoned herself&mdash;and so died
in bed&mdash;watched. Under the precautions, that is unlikely&mdash;too refined. The
manner of Seyton, "The Queen, my Lord, is dead," shows to me that it was
hourly expected. How these few words would <i>seek</i> into you, did you first read
the Play in mature age! She died a natural death&mdash;of remorse. Take my
word for it&mdash;the rumour to the contrary was natural to the lip and ear of
Hate.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>A question of primary import is&mdash;What is the relation of feeling between him
and her? The natural impression, I think, is, that the confiding affection&mdash;the
intimate confidence&mdash;is "there"&mdash;of a husband and wife who love one another&mdash;to
whom all interests are in common, and are consulted in common.
Without this belief, the Magic of the Tragedy perishes&mdash;vanishes to me.
"My dearest love, Duncan comes here to-night." "Be innocent of the knowledge,
<i>dearest Chuck</i>"&mdash;a marvellous phrase for Melpomene. It is the full union&mdash;for
ill purposes&mdash;that we know habitually for good purposes&mdash;that to me
tempers the Murder Tragedy.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Yet believe me, my dear Talboys&mdash;that of all the murders Macbeth may
have committed, she knew beforehand but of <span class="smcap">ONE</span>&mdash;Duncan's. The haunted
somnambulist speaks the truth&mdash;the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>"The Thane of Fife had a Wife." Does not that imply that she was privy
to <i>that</i> Murder?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>No. Except that she takes upon herself <i>all</i> the murders that are the offspring,
legitimate or illegitimate, of that First Murder. But we <i>know</i> that
Macbeth, in a sudden fit of fury, ordered the Macduffs to be massacred when
on leaving the Cave Lenox told him of the Thane's flight.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>That is decisive.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>A woman, she feels for a murdered woman. That is all&mdash;a touch of nature&mdash;from
Shakspeare's profound and pitiful heart.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>"The Queen, my lord, is dead." "She should have died hereafter; There
would have been a time for such a word"&mdash;Often have I meditated on the meaning
of these words&mdash;yet even now I do not fully feel or understand them.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Nor I. This seems to look from them&mdash;"so pressed by outward besiegings,
I have not capacity to entertain the blow as it requires to be entertained.
With a free soul I could have measured it. Now I cannot."</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Give us, sir, a commentary on the Revelations of the Sleeping Spectre.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I dare not. Let's be cheerful. I ask this&mdash;when you see and hear Kemble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</a></span>-Macbeth&mdash;and
Siddons-Macbeth&mdash;whom do you believe that you see
and hear? I affirm that you at one and the same instant&mdash;(or at the
most in two immediately successive instants&mdash;yet I believe in one and the
same instant)&mdash;<i>know</i> that you see and hear Kemble&mdash;or if that accomplished
gentleman and admirable actor&mdash;Macready be performing the part&mdash;then
Macready;&mdash;and yet <i>believe</i> that you see and hear Lord Macbeth. I aver
that you entertain a mixt&mdash;confused&mdash;self-contradictory state of mind&mdash;that
two elements of thought which cannot co-subsist do co-subsist.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p><i>De jure</i> they cannot&mdash;<span class="smcap">DE FACTO</span> they do.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Just so.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>They co-subsist fighting, and yet harmonising&mdash;there is half-belief&mdash;semi-illusion.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I claim the acknowledgment of such a state&mdash;which any one who chooses
may better describe, but which shall come to that effect&mdash;for the lowest substratum
of all science and criticism concerning <span class="smcap">Poesy</span>. Will anybody grant
me this, then I will reason with him about Poesy, for we begin with something
in common. Will anybody deny me this, then I will not argue with
him about Poesy, for we set out with nothing in common.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>We grant you all you ask&mdash;we are all agreed&mdash;"our unanimity is wonderful."</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Leave out the great Brother and Sister, and take the Personated alone. I
<i>know</i> that Othello and Desdemona never existed&mdash;that an Italian Novelist
began, and an English Dramatist ended them&mdash;and there they are. But do I
not <i>believe</i> in their existence, "their loves and woes?" Yes I do <i>believe</i> in
their existence, in their loves and woes&mdash;and I hate Iago accordingly with a
vicious, unchristian, personal, active, malignant hatred.</p>

<p>Preface to Shakspeare&mdash;is idle, and frivolous, and false?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>It is. He belies his own experience. He cannot make up his mind to
admit the <i>irrational thought</i> of belief which you at once reject and accept.
But exactly the half acceptance, and the half rejection, separates poetry from&mdash;prose.</p>

<p>That is, sir, the poetical from the prosaic.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Just so. It is the life and soul of all poetry&mdash;the lusus&mdash;the make-believe&mdash;the
glamour and the gramarye. I do not know&mdash;gentlemen&mdash;I wish to be
told, whether I am now throwing away words upon the setting up of a pyramid
which was built by Cheops, and is only here and there crumbling a little,
or whether the world requires that the position shall be formally argued and
acknowledged. Johnson, as you reminded me, Talboys, did not admit it.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>That he tells us in so many words. Has any more versed and profound
master in criticism, before or since, authentically and authoritatively, luminously,
cogently, explicitly, psychologically, metaphysically, physiologically,
psychologically, propounded, reasoned out, legislated, and enthroned the
Dogma?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I know not, Talboys. Do you admit the Dogma?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[Pg 646]</a></span></p>

<p>Impersonation&mdash;Apostrophe&mdash;of the absent; every poetical motion of the
Soul; the whole pathetic beholding of Nature&mdash;involve the secret existence
and necessity of this irrational psychical state for grounding the Logic of
Poesy.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Go on, sir.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I will&mdash;but in a new direction. Before everything else, I desire, for the
settlement of this particular question, a foundation for, and some progress
in the science of <span class="smcap">Murder Tragedies</span>.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>I know <i>properly</i> two.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Two only? Pray name.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>This of Macbeth and Richard III.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>The Agamemnon&mdash;the Choephor&aelig;&mdash;the Electra&mdash;the Medea&mdash;</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>In the Agamemnon, your regard is drawn to Agamemnon himself and to
Cassandra. However, it is after a measure a prototype. Clytemnestra
has in it a principality. Medea stands eminent&mdash;but then she is in the right.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>In the right?</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Jason at least is altogether in the wrong. But we must&mdash;for
obvious reasons&mdash;discuss the Greek drama by itself; therefore not a word more about
it now.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Richard III., and Macbeth and his wife, are in their Plays the principal
people. You must go along with them to a certain guarded extent&mdash;else the
Play is done for. To be kept abhorring and abhorring, for Five Acts
together, you can't stand.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Oh! that the difference between Poetry and Life were once for all set down&mdash;and
not only once for all, but every time that it comes in question.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>My dear sir, do gratify Seward's very reasonable desire, and once for all set
down the difference.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>You bear suicides on the stage, and tyrannicides and other cides&mdash;all simple
homicide&mdash;much murder. Even Romeo's killing Tybalt in the street, in reparation
for Mercutio's death, you would take rather differently, if happening
to-day in Pall Mall, or Moray Place.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>We have assuredly for the Stage a qualified scheme of sentiment&mdash;grounded
no doubt on our modern or every-day morality&mdash;but specifically modified by
Imagination&mdash;by Poetry&mdash;for the use of the dramatist. Till we have set
down what we <i>do</i> bear, and why, we are not prepared for distinguishing what
we won't bear, and why.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Oracular!</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Suggestive.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>And if so, sufficient for the nonce. Hamlet's uncle, Claudius, seems to me
to be the most that can be borne of one purely abhorrible. He is made disgust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[Pg 647]</a></span>ing
besides&mdash;drunken and foul. Able he is&mdash;for he won the Queen by
"witchcraft of his wit;" but he is made endurable by his diminished proportion
in the Play&mdash;many others overpowering and hiding him.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Pardon me, sir, but I have occasionally felt, in course of this conversation,
that you were seeking&mdash;in opposition to Payne Knight&mdash;to reduce Macbeth to
a species of Claudius. I agree with you in thinking that Shakspeare would
not give a Claudius so large a proportion of his drama. The pain would be
predominant and insupportable.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I would fain hope you have misunderstood me, Buller.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Sometimes, sir, it is not easy for a plain man to know what you would be at.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I?</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Yea&mdash;you.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Richard III. <i>is</i> a hypocrite&mdash;a hard, cold murderer from of old&mdash;and
yet you bear him. I suppose, friends, chiefly from his pre-eminent Intellectual
Faculties, and his perfectly courageous and self-possessed Will. You do
support your conscience&mdash;or traffic with it&mdash;by saying all along&mdash;we are only
conducting him to the retribution of Bosworth Field. But, friends, if these motions
in Macbeth, which look like revealings and breathings of some better elements,
are sheer and vile hypocrisy&mdash;if it is merely his manhood that quails,
which his wife has to virilify&mdash;a dastard and a hypocrite, and no more&mdash;I
cannot abide him&mdash;there is too much of a bad business, and then I must
think Shakspeare has committed an egregious error in Poetry. Richard III.
is a bold, heroic hypocrite. He knows he is one. He lies to Man&mdash;never
to his own Conscience, or to Heaven.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Never. There he is clear-sighted, and stands, like Satan, in open and
impious rebellion.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>But your Macbeth, sir, would be a shuffling Puritan&mdash;a mixture of Holy
Willie and Greenacre. Forgive me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Order&mdash;order&mdash;order.</p>

<p>My dear Buller&mdash;you have misunderstood me&mdash;I assure you you have.
Some of my expressions may have been too strong&mdash;not sufficiently
qualified.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>I accept the explanation. But be more guarded in future, my dear sir.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>I will.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>On that assurance I ask you, sir, how is the Tragedy of Macbeth morally
saved? That is, how does the degree of complacency with which we consider
the two murderers not morally taint ourselves&mdash;not leave us predisposed
murderers?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>That is a question of infinite compass and fathom&mdash;answered then only when
the whole Theory of Poesy has been expounded.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Whew!</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>The difference established between our contemplation of the Stage and of
Life.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>I hardly expect that to be done this Summer in this Tent.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Friends! Utilitarians and Religionists shudder and shun. They consider the
Stage and Life as of one and the same kind&mdash;look on both through one glass.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Eh?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>The Utilitarian will settle the whole question of Life upon half its data&mdash;the
lowest half. He accepts Agriculture, which he understands logically&mdash;but
rejects Imagination, which he does not understand at all&mdash;because, if you
sow it in the track of his plough, no wheat springs. Assuredly not; a different
plough must furrow a different soil for that seed and that harvest.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Now, my dear sir, you speak like yourself. You always do so&mdash;the rashness
was all on my side.</p>

<p>SEWARD.</p>

<p>Nobody cares&mdash;hold your tongue.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>The Religionist errs from the opposite quarter. He brings measures from
Heaven to measure things of the Earth. He weighs Clay in the balance of
Spirit. I call him a Religionist who overruns with religious rules and conceptions
things that do not come under them&mdash;completely distinct from the
native simplicity and sovereignty of Religion in a piously religious heart. Both
of them are confounders of the sciences which investigate the Facts and the
Laws of Nature, visible and invisible&mdash;subduing inquiry under preconception.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Was that the Gong&mdash;or but thunder?</p>

Malcolm and his brother have reached England and Ireland&mdash;time for the
King of England to interest himself in behalf of Malcolm, and muster his
array. More than this seems unrequired. But the zenith of tyranny to
which Macbeth has arrived, and particularly the manner of describing the
desolation of Scotland by the speakers in England, conveys to you the notion
of a long, long dismal reign. Of old it always used to do so with me; so
that when I came to visit the question of the Time, I felt myself as if baffled
and puzzled, not finding the time I had looked for, demonstrable. Samuel
Johnson has had the same impression, but has not scrutinised the data. He
goes probably by the old Chronicler for the actual time, and this, one would
think, must have floated before Shakspeare's own mind.</p>

<p>Ay, Talboys, that is true Shakspeare. No Poet&mdash;before or since&mdash;has in
so few words presented such a picture. No poet, before or since, has used
<i>such</i> words. He writes like a man inspired.</p>

<p>I was not aware of it. Now, my dear Talboys, let us here endeavour to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</a></span>
ascertain Shakspeare's Time. Here we have long time with a vengeance&mdash;<i>and

<p>Macduff, moved by Rosse's words, asks him, you know, Talboys, "how
does my wife?" And then ensues the affecting account of her murder, which
you need not recite. Now, I ask, when was the murder of Lady Macduff
perpetrated? Two days&mdash;certainly not more&mdash;after the murder of Banquo.
Macbeth, incensed by the flight of Fleance, goes, the morning after the murder
of Banquo, to the Weirds, to know by "the worst means, the worst."
You know what they showed him&mdash;and that, as they vanished, he exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>And his purpose does not cool&mdash;for the whole Family are murdered. When,
then, took place the murder of Banquo? Why, a week or two after the Murder
of Duncan. A very short time indeed, then, intervened between the first
and the last of these Murders. And yet from those pictures of Scotland,
painted in England for our information and horror, we have before us a long,
long time, all filled up with butchery over all the land! But I say there had
been no such butchery&mdash;or anything resembling it. There was, as yet, little
amiss with Scotland. Look at the <i>linking</i> of Acts II. and III. End of Act
II., Macbeth is gone to Scone&mdash;to be invested. Beginning of Act III., Banquo
says, in soliloquy, in Palace of Fores, "Thou hast it <i>now</i>." I ask, when
is <i>this</i> <span class="smcap">NOW</span>? Assuredly just after the Coronation. The Court was moved
from Scone to Fores, which, we may gather from finding Duncan there formerly,
to be the usual Royal Residence. "Enter Macbeth as King." "Our
great Feast"&mdash;our "solemn Supper"&mdash;"this day's Council"&mdash;all have the
aspect of new taking on the style of Royalty. "Thou hast it <span class="smcap">NOW</span>," is formal&mdash;weighed&mdash;and
in a position that gives it authority&mdash;at the very beginning
of an Act&mdash;therefore intended to mark time&mdash;a very pointing of the finger
on the dial.</p>

<p>Do, sir, let him perpend.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Banquo <i>fears</i> "Thou play'dst most foully for it;" he goes no farther&mdash;not
a word of any tyranny done. All the style of an incipient, <i>dangerous</i> Rule&mdash;clouds,
but no red rain yet. And I need not point out to you, Talboys, who
carry Shakspeare unnecessarily in a secret pocket of that strange Sporting
Jacket, which the more I look at it the greater is my wonder&mdash;that Macbeth's
behaviour at the Banquet, on seeing Banquo nodding at him from his own
stool, proves him to have been <i>then</i> young in blood.</p>

<p>He had a week or two before committed a first-rate murder, Duncan's&mdash;that
night he had, by hired hands, got a second-rate job done, Banquo's&mdash;and
the day following he gave orders for a bloody business on a more extended
scale, the Macduffs. But nothing here the least like Rosse's, or Macduff's, or
Malcolm's Picture of Scotland&mdash;during those few weeks. For Shakspeare forgot
what the true time was&mdash;his own time&mdash;<i>the short time</i>; and introduced
<i>long time at the same time</i>&mdash;why, he himself no doubt knew&mdash;and you no doubt,
Talboys, know also&mdash;and will you have the goodness to tell the "why" to the

<p>I call that an <span class="smcap">Astounding Discovery</span>. Macduff speaks as if he knew
that Scotland had been for ever so long desolated by the Tyrant&mdash;and yet till
Rosse told him, never had he heard of the Murder of his own Wife! Here
Shakspeare either forgot himself wholly, and the short time he had himself
assigned&mdash;or, with his eyes open, forced in the <i>long time</i> upon the <i>short</i>&mdash;in
wilful violation of possibility! All silent?</p>

<p>Pray, Talboys, explain to me <i>this</i>. The Banquet scene breaks up in most
admired disorder&mdash;"stand not upon the order of your going&mdash;but go at once,"&mdash;quoth
the Queen. The King, in a state of great excitement, says to her&mdash;</p>

been at the Banquet. Had he gone to bed after that strange Supper? No
doubt, for an hour or two&mdash;like the rest of "the Family." But whether he
went to bed or not, <i>then and there</i> he and another Lord had a confidential
and miraculous conversation.</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Miraculous! What's miraculous about it?</p>

<p>Who told him all this about Banquo and Fleance? He speaks of it quite
familiarly to the "other lord," as a thing well known in all its bearings.
But not a soul but Macbeth, and the Three Murderers themselves, could
possibly have known anything about it! As for Banquo, "Safe in a ditch
he bides,"&mdash;and Fleance had fled. The body may, perhaps in a few days, be
found, and, though "with twenty trenched gashes on its head," identified as
Banquo's, and, in a few weeks, Fleance may turn up in Wales. Nay, the
Three Murderers may confess. But now all is hush; and Lenox, unless
endowed with second sight, or clairvoyance, could know nothing of the
murder. Yet, from his way of speaking of it, one might imagine crowner's
'quest had sitten on the body&mdash;and the report been in the <i>Times</i> between
supper and that after-supper confab! I am overthrown&mdash;everted&mdash;subverted&mdash;the
contradiction is flagrant&mdash;the impossibility monstrous&mdash;I swoon.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Water&mdash;water.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Thank you, Buller. That's revivifying&mdash;I see now all objects distinctly.
Where was I? O, ay. The "other Lord" seems as warlock-wise as Lenox&mdash;for
he looks forward to times when</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"We may again<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>An allusion, beyond doubt, to the murder of Banquo! A sudden thought
strikes me. Why, not only must the real, actual, spiritual, corporeal Ghost of
Banquo <i>sate on the stool</i>, but "Lenox and the other Lord," as well as
Macbeth, <i>saw him</i>.</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Are you serious, sir?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>So serious that I can scarcely hope to recover my usual spirits to-day.
Have you, gentlemen, among you any more plausible solution to offer? All
mum. One word more with you. Lenox tells the "other Lord"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"From broad words, and 'cause he fail'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Macduff lives in disgrace; Sir, can you tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where he bestows himself</span>?"<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[Pg 653]</a></span></p>
<p>And the "other Lord," who is wonderfully well informed for a person
"strictly anonymous," replies that Macduff&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Is gone to pray the holy king, (Edward) on his aid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wake Northumberland, and warlike Siward."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nay, he minutely describes Macduff's surly reception of the King's messenger,
sent to invite him to the Banquet, and the happy style of that official on
getting the Thane of Fife's "absolute, Sir, not I," and D. I. O.! And the
same nameless "Lord in waiting" says to Lenox, that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">"<i>this report</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hath so exasperate the king, that he</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Prepares for some attempt of war</i>."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I should like to know first where and when these two gifted individuals picked
up all this information? The king himself had told the Queen, that same
night, that he had <i>not sent</i> to Macduff&mdash;but that he had heard "by the way"
that he was not coming to the Banquet&mdash;and he only <i>learns</i> the flight of Macduff
after the Cauldron Scene&mdash;that is at end of it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Macbeth.</i> Come in, without there!<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Macbeth.</i> <span class="smcap">Fled to England</span>?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For an Usurper and Tyrant, his Majesty is singularly ill-informed about the
movements of his most dangerous Thanes! But Lenox, I think, must have
been not a little surprised at that moment to find that, so far from the <i>exasperated</i>
Tyrant having "<i>prepared for some attempt of war</i>" with England&mdash;he
had not till then positively known that Macduff had fled! I pause, as a man
pauses who has no more to say&mdash;not for a reply. But to be sure, Talboys
will reply to anything&mdash;and were I to say that the Moon is made of green
cheese, he would say&mdash;yellow&mdash;</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>If of weeping Parmesan, then I&mdash;of the "cheese without a tear"&mdash;Double
Gloster.</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>The whole Dialogue between Lenox and the Lord is <i>miraculous</i>. It
abounds with knowledge of events that had not happened&mdash;and <i>could not</i>
have happened&mdash;on the showing of Shakspeare himself; but I do not believe
that there is another man now alive who knows that Lenox and the "other
Lord" are caught up and strangled in that <i>noose of Time</i>. Did the Poet?
You would think, from the way they go on, that one ground of war, one
motive of Macduff's going, is the murder of Banquo&mdash;perpetrated since he is
gone off!</p>

<p>TALBOYS.</p>

<p>Eh?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, I have given you a specimen or two of Shakspeare's way of
dealing with Time&mdash;and I can elicit no reply. You are one and all dumbfoundered.
What will you be&mdash;where will you be&mdash;when I&mdash;</p>

<p>BULLER.</p>

<p>Have announced "all my astounding discoveries!" and where, also, will
be poor Shakspeare&mdash;where his Critics?</p>

<p>NORTH.</p>

<p>Friends, Countrymen, and Romans, lend me your ears! A dazzling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[Pg 654]</a></span>
spell is upon us that veils from our apprehension all incompatibilities&mdash;all
impossibilities&mdash;for he dips the Swan-quill in Power&mdash;and Power is that which
you must accept from him, and so to the utter oblivion, while we read or
behold, of them all. To go to work with such inquiries is to try to articulate
thunder. What do I intend? That Shakspeare is only to be <i>thus</i> criticised?
Apollo forbid&mdash;forbid the Nine! I intend Prologomena to the Criticism of
Shakspeare. I intend mowing and burning the brambles before ploughing the
soil. I intend showing where we must not look for the Art and the Genius
of Shakspeare, as a step to discovering where we must. I suspect&mdash;I know&mdash;that
Criticism has oscillated from one extreme to another, in the mind of
the country&mdash;from denying all art, to acknowledging consummated art, and no
flaw. I would find the true Point. Stamped and staring upon the front of these
Tragedies is a conflict. He, the Poet, beholds Life&mdash;he, the Poet, is on the
Stage. The littleness of the Globe Theatre mixes with the greatness of human
affairs. You think of the Green-room and the Scene-shifters. I think that
when we have stripped away the disguises and incumbrances of the Power, we
shall see, naked, and strong, and beautiful, the statue moulded by Jupiter.</p>
